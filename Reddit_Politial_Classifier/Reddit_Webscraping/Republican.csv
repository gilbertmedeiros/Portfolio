There is no transparency in most binding arbitration agreements, and they often include nondisclosure provisions. What\'s more, class actions deal with the expense and fear of retaliation problems of solo claims. As Ginsburg put it, ""there\'s safety in numbers.""\n\n> Yale Law professor Judith Resnik observed that the decision applies to all manner of class actions.

""While Congress is of course always free to amend this judgment, we see nothing suggesting it did so in the NLRA — much less that it manifested a clear intention to displace the Arbitration Act. Because we can easily read Congress\'s statutes to work in harmony, that is where our duty lies.""\n\nGorsuch is exactly right. This doesn\'t mean it\'s wrong to pass a law per se that would make that the case. But it not being the case, the court is bound to rule this way. This just means that the labor unions should lobby to make this the way things are.

Employees (or potential employees) have no power to negotiate terms such as this. You might be able to wiggle around in a range for benefits and such, but when it comes to opting out of such a clause, the immediate red flag would be that there's a potential that you intend to sue later down the road. \n\nPersonally, I feel that all unilateral arbitration clauses are complete shit. It's in absolutely everything now - event tickets, software EULAs, mortgages and other loans, credit card agreements, on the back of sales receipts, quite literally everywhere.

Ginsburg seems to be arguing the wrong thing. She\'s basically saying that since the 1925 law is so old, it shouldn\'t be applicable to the circumstances that the workers are facing today. While both arguments have their merits in their own right, the majority\'s opinion is based upon how the system is supposed to work instead of optimistic idealism.', ""I'd say that the US Constitution doesn't give the government any authority to intrude on the personal dealings of employers and employees, specifically through workers rights legislation.

The NLRA does not mandate that class actions be available to workers—which is obvious when you harmonize the statues and recognize that Congress could have made it clear that class actions were available to them regardless of union contracts had they wanted to. It’s a stretch to say that “concerted activity” means some kind of particular legal action when the rest of the subsection was directed toward collective bargaining and the like. \n\nBut hell, I’m all for workers being able to use class actions.

Mueller\'s team continues to say that there is a connection that puts the charges within the scope, but that due national security concerns and the ongoing investigation, they can\'t tell the judge. Ellis doesn\'t seem to buy that, which is understandable since it\'s pretty darn hard to rule on this motion without that information. Ellis says he suspects that the only real connection to the Mueller investigation is the hope that Manafort will flip, and keeping the case within Mueller\'s office makes it easier to negotiate the plea deal.\n\nManafort is of course asking that the case be dismissed with prejudice, meaning the charges could never be brought again. This is incredibly unlikely. Even with a skeptical Republican appointed judge like Ellis, the most we are looking at is a dismissal without prejudice followed immediately by the US Attorney\'s office for Eastern District of Virginia refiling the charges. During the hearing Ellis always framed the issue in terms of why not hand off the case rather than why bring it at all, and even at one point said ""I’m not saying it’s illegitimate"" referring to the charges against Manafort.\n\nAlso, Manafort\'s other charges \\(money laundering and acting as an agent for the pro\\-Russian Ukraine government while unregistered\\) seem more clearly within the scope of the investigation, and will likely continue on in front of a different federal judge over in Washington.

"['> But it’s wrong to suggest, as Martin Indyk concludes in The Atlantic, that the Trump administration’s Middle East policy is effectively no different from President Obama’s “leading from behind.” Critics are not giving Trump enough credit: He does have a strategy for Syria and the broader Middle East. His strategy is to limit American involvement, to push responsibility for outcomes in the region back onto states in the region, and to let power determine outcomes. He has no particular affinity for states in the region, and professes to be a devoted friend to each without committing to enduring obligations to any. He is indifferent to government type, and just as likely to be a benefactor to authoritarians as to democrats. It is an approach international relations theorists call “realism,” of the variant called “offshore balancing,” as he seeks to withdraw U.S. forces from the region.\n\nThis is the end state I desire as far as the middle east is concerned, ""leave it and not have to come back"". \n\nbut how we do that matters.  I give two figs about ""nation building"" but I do care about extremists gaining power and  influence enough to be a threat.  If it were possible to get the middle east to understand, on a generational level, we don\'t fucking care what you do just leave us and everyone else the fuck alone and out of your propaganda, we\'d happily leave.  But sadly, I know the popularity of ""death to America"" all too well...\n\nI don\'t know if this will end up requiring us to return in 6 years, 2 years or 50 but I do know that the message that we just want to leave and not have to comeback is not being heard.  So maybe if we get Iraq and Syria to a point where THEY keep extremists down on their own.\n\n> But he is willing to act punitively and in a limited way to penalize chemical weapons use.  This he has done without letting it upend his strategy: It is not a commitment to change the horrible and predictable outcome of the Syrian civil war; it is narrowly constrained to avoid involving Iran or Russia.\n\nAnd well we should.  I don\'t get what people want here?  Asad or stable middle east, we cant have both... sadly... we learned this with Saddam\n\n> That approach is actually different than Obama’s. Obama was self-deterred, whereas Trump—or at least his administration—runs limited risks. Obama generated false hope among reformers and victims; Trump generates no hope.  But he does have a strategy, and it does carefully assess and manage risk to achieve its aims.\n\nThe stoics believe that hope is the opioid of the masses...

Other extreme becomes totalitarian, so all things being equal, wouldn't we prefer a totalitarian state where we all are equal? This paradigm weirdly makes a totalitarian socialism the lesser of two evils... it also makes the average student believe that conservatives are racist because they are on the racist side of the spectrum. Even if most people lie towards thr middle of the spectrum, the one side, in its extreme form, is racist and so racist beliefs must underpin the ideals of conservatives.\n\nThat spectrum is a horrible generalization. If there is to be a spectrum at all it ought to be zero government at one end and totalitarian at the other. So anarchists are basically one side and then communist and fascist dictatorships are on the other side. That spectrum would always put democrats (assuming they keep pushing to more progressive tendencies) closer to both fascists and communists than conservatives.
