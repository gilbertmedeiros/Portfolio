Check their website, they listed what laws they wanted implemented, and none of them would do anything to curtail violence\n\nUniversal Background checks:\nYou simply can’t enforce background checks for all private sales, those who were looking for a way around the law will just not get a background check. It’s like mandating all drug dealers have their clients present a drivers license, some are simply not going to do it.\n\nModernizing the ATF:\nThey already have registries in Illinois, but they found he vast vast majority of cases the weapon used in a homicide was illegally obtained or was used by someone other than the registered owner.\n\n\nFund the CDC:\nThe CDC could always do research for it, they just wouldn’t have funding for that program if they did. Even the , we have FBI stats on homicides overall and weapons used in them (vast majority are with handguns, followed by knives, unidentified firearms, fists, shotguns, rifles)\n\nHigh Capacity magazine ban:\nIt didn’t stop Parkland (the shooter used smaller 10 round magazines on purpose, they are more concealable). It didn’t stop Santa Fe (the shooter used a shotgun and a .38, neither holds more than 8 rounds)\n“Oh but what about 100 drum mags”\nIf anything, I’d want a shooter to use drum mags, as in both instances I can recall a drum mag being used in a crime (Aurora and that one Heist in North Vegas), both times the rifle jammed and the user ditched it for a different weapon. Drum mags are notorious for jamming often (several times in a single magazine, which is why he military doesn’t use them).\n\nBan assault weapons:\nAn “assault weapon” as used by gun control advocates is a misnomer. Actual military rifles, such as the M4A1 carbine, have 3-position fire selectors. That means you can set it to safe, semiautomatic (1 trigger pull means 1 round fired), and fully automatic (the gun fires for as long as you hold the trigger and have ammo).\n\nCivilian variants however, only have 2 position fire sectors, safe and semi. They also have narrower lower receivers (the part legally recognized as the gun), meaning you can’t fit a military automatic sear into it. So gun control advocates needed to redefine what assault weapon meant.\n\nSo in response, the Clinton Ban (1994-2004) banned:\nSemiautomatic rifles with detachable magazines with 2 or more features:\n\nForegrip (a piece of plastic you can hold onto)\n\nPistol grip (another piece of plastic you hold onto)\n\nBayonet lug (a metal piece that allows you to mount a knife onto the barrel without duct tape)\n\nGrenade launcher mount (slots and cuts in the gun that allow you to mount a grenade launcher, which are already restricted, without duct tape\n\nThreaded barrel which can mount a flashhider (this device largely just keeps dirt from blowing into your face while firing prone. And while it can “hide” flash, flashes are pretty much invisible in the daytime, and in the darkest of nights you’ll still see a flash, maybe not as big though. However, the gun is still loud, you hear the gun shot and the bullet breaking the sound barrier)\n\nJust another fun fact about the Clinton Ban, overall rifle deaths declined after the ban expired.\n\n\n\nBut looking over their policies, even presuming the “worked”, none of them would have stopped shootings like Virginia Tech, Columbine (which happened during the Clinton Ban), Santa Fe, YouTube, and so on.\n\n\n\nI’m not saying what they went through means nothing, it’s terrible to lose people like that, but it would seem gun free zones don’t work, and that relying on the police alone will fail you (jut like it did at Parkland).\n\n\n']",democrats,647781,House Democrats Offer Internships For Students Affected By Gun Violence,2

Pp. 2–53.\n\n> (a) The Amendment’s prefatory clause announces a purpose, but does not limit or expand the scope of the second part, the operative clause. The operative clause’s text and history demonstrate that it connotes an individual right to keep and bear arms. Pp. 2–22.\n\n>(b) The prefatory clause comports with the Court’s interpretation of the operative clause. The “militia” comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. The Antifederalists feared that the Federal Government would disarm the people in order to disable this citizens’ militia, enabling a politicized standing army or a select militia to rule. The response was to deny Congress power to abridge the ancient right of individuals to keep and bear arms, so that the ideal of a citizens’ militia would be preserved. Pp. 22–28.\n\n> (c) The Court’s interpretation is confirmed by analogous arms-bearing rights in state constitutions that preceded and immediately followed the Second Amendment. Pp. 28–30.\n\n> (d) The Second Amendment’s drafting history, while of dubious interpretive worth, reveals three state Second Amendment proposals that unequivocally referred to an individual right to bear arms. Pp. 30–32.\n\n> (e) Interpretation of the Second Amendment by scholars, courts and legislators, from immediately after its ratification through the late 19th century also supports the Court’s conclusion. Pp. 32–47.\n\n> (f) None of the Court’s precedents forecloses the Court’s interpretation. Neither United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542, nor Presser v. Illinois, 116 U. S. 252, refutes the individual-rights interpretation. United States v. Miller, 307 U. S. 174, does not limit the right to keep and bear arms to militia purposes, but rather limits the type of weapon to which the right applies to those used by the militia, i.e., those in common use for lawful purposes.\n\n> (2) **Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose**: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues. The Court’s opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. Miller’s holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those “in common use at the time” finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons. Pp. 54–56.\n\n> (3) The handgun ban and the trigger-lock requirement (as applied to self-defense) violate the Second Amendment. The District’s total ban on handgun possession in the home amounts to a prohibition on an entire class of “arms” that Americans overwhelmingly choose for the lawful purpose of self-defense. Under any of the standards of scrutiny the Court has applied to enumerated constitutional rights, this prohibition – in the place where the importance of the lawful defense of self, family, and property is most acute – would fail constitutional muster. Similarly, the requirement that any lawful firearm in the home be disassembled or bound by a trigger lock makes it impossible for citizens to use arms for the core lawful purpose of self-defense and is hence unconstitutional. Because Heller conceded at oral argument that the D.C. licensing law is permissible if it is not enforced arbitrarily and capriciously, the Court assumes that a license will satisfy his prayer for relief and does not address the licensing requirement. Assuming he is not disqualified from exercising Second Amendment rights, the District must permit Heller to register his handgun and must issue him a license to carry it in the home.

Wants to bring back county gun boards for concealed carry permits and give them more discretion.\n\nFollowing is from his website.\n\nGun Safety\n\nAs a new father, I’m learning that you always worry about your child. But when you send them off to school, you shouldn’t have to worry they will fall victim to gun violence. But that story is now all too common in America, from mass shootings in places like Aurora to Kalamazoo and Parkland. But mass shootings are only part of the story – in Detroit, where I was Health Commissioner, death by homicide is the most common cause of death among young men aged 12-35. From 2008-2013, over 6,000 Michiganders were killed by gun violence – making it deadlier than traffic fatalities. And Michigan is also not immune to the epidemic of mass shooters. In 2016, a mentally unstable man who never should have possessed a gun went on a shooting rampage in Kalamazoo, killing six people and 2 others injured.\n\nClearly, gun violence is a national epidemic. Enough is enough.\n\nThe time is long overdue to treat this as the public health issue it is. As Governor of Michigan, I won’t stop working until no parent has to bury her child. Too many elected officials are scared of a corporate gun lobby that is more concerned with making profits for gun manufacturers than promoting responsible gun ownership. I will never take a dime from the gun lobby. I am beholden to no one but the people of Michigan, and I will work for common-sense steps to reduce gun violence and keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn’t have them, like domestic abusers and violent criminals.\n\nHere are my commitments to make Michigan a safer and more responsible state:\n\n1. Prohibit the sale or possession of “weapons of war,” large capacity magazines, and any modifiers that increase fire rate. Growing up, I spent time with my family in Gratiot and Montcalm County - I came to respect Michigan hunting culture and tradition. My own uncle even learned how to prepare the venison he’d hunt halal so that his Muslim family members could also enjoy it. However, we must recognize that military-style assault weapons like the AR-15 – the weapon of choice for mass shooters – are not required to take down a buck. These weapons of war are meant for one thing: killing people during war. For that reason, these weapons and any accessories meant to increase their killing ability should be banned from sale in Michigan.\n\n2. Close background check loopholes. Currently, Michigan law does not require background checks for sales at gun shows, by private sellers, and for the sale of firearms other than handguns. As Governor, I will support background checks for all gun sales, including the sale of long guns. This could be achieved by expanding the current purchase-to-permit system to cover handguns and long guns, so that purchase permits are required to buy any type of guns from private sellers.\n\n3. Include domestic abusers in Michigan’s prohibited purchaser provisions. The presence of a firearm in a Domestic Violence situation makes it 5 times more likely a woman will be murdered. In fact, over half of mass shooter incidents involve the killer shooting intimate partners or other family members, including their children. Currently, Michigan law is incredibly weak when it comes to prohibiting convicted domestic abusers from purchasing or possessing guns. Common sense legislation to prevent domestic abusers from obtaining firearms must do all of the following:\n\n    Prohibit individuals convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors from possessing or purchasing firearms;\n    Require courts to notify individuals convicted of domestic abuse that they are no longer allowed to possess ammunition or firearms;\n    Require the surrender of firearms or ammunition by individuals convicted of domestic abuse;\n    Require law enforcement to remove firearms from the scene of a domestic violence incident.\n\n4. Require the Michigan State Police and local law enforcement to disarm individuals who become prohibited purchasers after purchasing a weapon, being issued a handgun purchase license, or receiving a concealed carry permit. Federal law does not require licensed dealers to conduct a background check if the purchaser presents a state permit to purchase or possess firearms that meet certain conditions. Thus, any Michigander with a handgun purchase license or a concealed pistol license that was issued on or after November 22, 2005 are exempt from the federal background check requirement. This means that people who have become ineligible to possess firearms after getting these licenses may still be able to buy weapons without a background check if the state fails to remove these licenses in a timely manner.\n\n5. Reintroduce discretion into the concealed pistol permit process. Michigan is known as a “shall issue” state, meaning that county clerks - the only body authorized to issue concealed pistol permits - are required to issue permits to all qualified applicants. We need to reintroduce discretion into the process so that communities again have the ability to oversee who can carry a concealed weapon. One way this could be done is through a return to “county gun boards,” which had the final say over the issuance of concealed carry permits before 2000 in Michigan.\n\nMichigan should also implement a “red flag law,” which would allow family members and law enforcement to seek a court order to temporarily restrict or remove access to guns when a person poses a danger to themselves or others. Mass shooters and people contemplating suicide often display warning signs. Red flag laws allow family members and law enforcement to take action before tragedy occurs.\n\n6. Prohibit the open carry of firearms in public buildings and registered private establishments. Small business owners deserve the right to have a say whether or not their customers may carry a gun openly. Under this new system, business owners could enter their establishments into a state registry if they do not wish to allow open carry. And nobody should be able to carry a weapon onto school grounds.\n', ""Only God or Satan can perform tricks at that level, and why would God want to appoint someone to be Governor, He's God.\n\nNot sure what this Abdul character is up to, but he is no part of the Holy Trinity and he sure as hell is not the next Governor."", ""My local city installed a Fiber optic network that you could pay for access to.

Nothing I'd love more than for a real Democrat to take his seat in November."", ""> One, he's closely connected to Obama, having served in his administration, and we all know that Obama's possibly the only person the Republicans hate more than Hillary.\n\nSee, I see that as a net electoral strength.  For Democrats, Obama remains a powerful and energizing presence.  Biden's close association to Obama is a major portion of the reason that he leads the potential field in every poll.  FWIW, while I know Obama will be happy to play whatever role as surrogate the eventual nominee asks for, but for Biden?  Let's just say [he's a big fan](https://www.npr.org/2017/01/12/509545778/in-surprise-send-off-president-obama-awards-biden-presidential-medal-of-freedom), and that kind of authentic, heartfelt admiration is infectious.\n\nMeanwhile, that association doesn't seem to have rubbed off on Joe with republicans.  While a few months old, a quick search found [this poll](http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2018/images/01/23/rel1e.-.2020.pdf) that pegs Biden at -17 with voters that lean republican.  Compared to Obama hanging around -70 with those voters at the end of his term, or Clinton's -80 shortly before the election that's a substantial boost.  Hell, Bernie Sanders sits with almost twice that gap, with a -32 (29/61).\n\nWe're a long way from 2020 and the GOP will undoubtedly do everything they can to change that if Biden runs.  But at least we can be reasonably safe in saying Biden wouldn't be at a disadvantage because of this compared to the rest of the field.\n\n> Two, he'll be 78 by the time the 2020 winner takes office.\n\nAbsolutely, it's a legitimate concern.  In most past campaigns, it would've been a likely deal breaker.  But the GOP opponent in trump would only be 3 1/2 years younger.  And Bernie - perhaps the only serious challenger to Biden for the nomination - is over year older.  Add to that the fact that Biden is rather famously fit for his age and keeps a much healthier lifestyle than either of his septuagenarian challengers and I just don't think there's much area to hit Biden on age.  Especially if (as has been floated) he decided to limit himself to a single term when announcing, possibly with a VP already picked. "", 'Yeah? Who would conservatives hate to run against?\n', 'Don\'t see that. I am not a fan until recently-- despite his age, he\'s adopted much of Bernie\'s ""income inequality"" theme but with a better speech. He\'s been Too Conservative to me in the past but after his recent stirring speeches he\'s a pol\'s pol as well as a populist. A bit too soft on billionaires but then Americans are fairly pro-capitalism even though I am further left -- but I am a minority in that respect. Just getting a popular moderate left guy or woman is enough at this point -- who can deliver a political skill that many newer faces can\'t seem to deliver. The ""pol"" part is not easy to get.

They don’t see these moments as *evidence* of an unfit president but rather the *defamation* of one. \n\nI used to be friends with a MAGA shmuck who is rather bright (book wise I guess), though lacking common sense in many areas and a bit bigoted though he didn’t think so. We’d often have political discussions even before 2016 and though had our difference, could meet in the middle. They used to be constructive conversations until *J* started having a rough go at the end of 14 beginning of 15. By the time Trump splashed onto the scene, there was no getting through. He simply *couldn’t* acknowledge any negatives honestly, they were nothing’s for him. \n\nJ was by no means a bad guy, which is a real fucked thing to say following my previous statement, but in his reality he had basically one chance to get himself through school financially speaking. We could all see he was being overly ambitious in his career choice but what young person isn’t? Like a lot of people I know, he had changed courses a couple times and exhausted his financial aid. After only 3 years in post-secondary he was unable to acquire loans or student aid, to which he blamed “the system” despite him making horrible and expensive decisions and ultimately not achieving the grades he needed to. \n\nIt was not long after that a populist *billionaire* comes onto the scene preaching to be for the people who wants to *drain the swamp*. That really must have resonated. I hadn’t talked to him specifically about this, but I imagine he felt stuck at the time and latched onto Trump for all the same reasons you can read about. Ultimately I think he was just desperate. \n\nThe *real issue* I’m trying to highlight, as I believe was that his friends (myself included) all took the opposition in attacking Trumps character (qualifications and credibility etc etc) as being unfit to honestly represent the American people. *j* eventually became unable to separate the arguments against someone he supported from his own character and just became bitter about everything. His closeted bigotry surely did not help. \n\nHe’s always had an argumentative personality that had pushed most of his friends away, it’s just that recently I (one of his long standing friends) realized how truly toxic he became over the years. So while I don’t think Trump is entirely the reason this guy became an “against the grain asshole” as a mutual friend elegantly put it, MAGA was definitely a catalyst and attacking Trumps intelligence is likely a major *micro-factor*. \n\nBut seriously, if the man could just hire an editor and read a prompt. . .\n\n\nEdit: forgot to finish a point.

Have no transportation to work. \n\nThose are experiences that mold a person. They’re horrible but give a person perspective on life.\n\nTrump has never had to work his way up.

Obama told Trump not to hire Flynn, not because of a vendetta or to influence Trump but because Flynn would be a liability in that spot and it wouldn’t be good for the country. \n\nObama was someone that was a personification of the American Dream. He was what many of us aspire to be. Overcome our misfortunes, work hard, care, love, experience, learn, listen, optimistic. Obama didn’t need to compare himself to others for reassurance. He was self confident because he understood there are too many variables that it’s useless. The crisis’ are unique for every one. \n\nUltimately though, Obama respected others and understanding of others. He got frustrated at times, he would criticize the other party for games they were playing. But he never told people they don’t love America because they disagree with me. He understood the reasoning behind not standing for the national anthem,(I believe he disagreed with it but support their right to do it). He didn’t whine about his media coverage. He never called for a reporter to be fired because of a mistake that later was corrected. \n\nHe brought in people he disagreed with, he listened to them.

"[""> how was your day.\n\nGood, I went hiking and managed to not burn my face.\n\n> predominant topic of discussion for me in my political circle? \n\nLGBT issues, single payer health care, education access, unions and collective bargaining, and environmental protection.\n\n> What's going on in the other side of the mad house?\n\nI think most conservatives are not the ones that we see calling everyone libtards and wearing meme wars shirts. Thafs for sure. They may have taken over the popular discourse around conservatism around the election but I still think that the average Republican voted for Trump because he had an R next to his name just like the average Democrat voted for Hillary because she had a D next to hers.\n\nI think most conservatives are putting blinders on and ignoring some of the obviously not right things going on in the present administration. That being said, all politics are local and things are going to be different no matter where you go. I live in a very conservative suburb of Sacramento but most people here are not actually very socially conservative. I was shocked when a bunch of Republicans showed up to a school board meeting to tell the board to make a policy that would allow a 12 year old transgender girl to use the girls restroom. Being conservative is mostly about taxes here. \n\nSo, by support LGBT rights do you actually mean you just support gay people's rights or are transgender people along for the ride too? Whenever I see a conservative people on the internet say that, it's almost always with an asterisk next to it."", ""My day was fine. \n\nInternal politics? Eh, fine I guess. I feel like I've been a little shocked at America with Trump as they've lost all their morals. \n\nI mean Trump kind of dominates, he's constantly doing crazy things that no one has done in years. From the epa relaxing if regulations to crazy degrees to his wackiness in foreign policy and trade.  It kind of puts everything else on the backburner."", ""Former Republican then Libertarian now Democrat. LGBT rights is the most important issue at this point for me. You support LGBT rights too? Your party doesn't. For example in my state our governor, a Democrat in a very red state, issued an executive order protecting LGBT citizens and the Republican legislators killed it. This happens all over the country, just look at the things Pence did in Indiana. You may be for LGBT rights but your party as a whole on average is hiding behind religion to discriminate against LGBT citizens.\n\nAnd the Republican party is the so-called moral majority and religious-right. Yet they turn a blind eye to all of Trump's sexism and racism. The talking heads on the right spin this and side step it, but if Obama did one of the immoral/irreligious things Trump has done, the right would keep this on the top of their agenda for months nay years. Republicans hide behind religion and morality as a utilitarian act only when it is convenient.\n\nHere's something you can try to see if the right or left is being the most fair. Spend a week listening to Hannity/Limbaugh/Savage/etc on the radio. Then spend a week listening to NPR on the radio. Now ask yourself which of the 2 was the most inflamatory in tone and to what extent was this so in comparison to the other, and which of the 2 were the most objective and calm in tone and to what extent was this so in comparison to the other. Both sides are at fault but both sides are not equally at fault.\n\nThis is why I left the Republican party.

That would be a bit like Democrats winning full control but with Al Sharpton as president (actually, not even that is an extreme enough comparison)\n\nClimate of internal politics - there\'s still a fight between moderates (derisively called ""Corporate Democrats"") and Progressives (for lack of a better label).  I worry that too many people see any compromise as capitulation - for example, a lot of Democrats are demanding any candidate pledge to fight for single-payer, but i personally think that\'s both unrealistic and political suicide.  \n\nTopics of conversation - even 18 months into this, it\'s still just daily amazement at what 40% of this country is willing to accept as normal - the levels of corruption among Trump\'s cabinet and family, the insanely high turnover, the hundreds of government positions that sit empty, the level of narcissist ego-mania, the Twitter outbursts, the contradictions (i.e. attacks his own AG and Sec. of State), the abundant evidence of both collusion and cover-up....and beyond all the true believers who will forgive anything there\'s all those on the Right who just go along with it all with barely a word of protest.  We want to move past being shocked by the daily outrages, but it\'s hard.  \n\nWhat I think is going on with the Right - they know there\'s a good chance they are screwed in 2018 and 2020, so they\'re juicing this presidency for all they can while they can - tax cuts, conservative judges, hawkish foreign policy - I think a lot of Republicans hate where they find themseleves but are willing to hold their nose and exploiut it as much as they can, especially since they have to lock in what they can since they might be out of power for a long while after this.  \n\nAnd my day is great, thanks - yours?', 'Hiya!  Former Republican here, I was a big McCainiac back in 2000 and gradually was alienated from the GOP during the Bush years.  I\'ll never forgive him for his \'illegitimate black baby\' trick he played in South Carolina.\n\nI\'m hanging in there.\n\nClimate seems fine, we\'re in decent spirits, there is a lot of hope, trying to make up for the intense dread that we\'re experiencing.  A lot is riding on 2018.\n\nThe big thing I\'m focused on is the rise of the alt-right.  I live in DC, and we get more than our fair share of white nationalist shitheads trying to cause trouble.  I\'ve seen people outside the White House in Nazi uniforms shouting into bullhorns about gassing Jews, I\'ve torn down several ""It\'s Okay To Be White"" posters, I\'ve taken down flyers for white supremacist meetups with razor blades on the edges to keep people like me from tampering with them.  I even saw and intimidated Richard Spencer when he was leaving a hotel two blocks from my apartment.  I have friends who are living in fear of these people, I have friends who\'ve been beaten by these people.  I hate these people, I want them gone, I want them driven out of power, I want them dead and buried, and the ground above their putrid corpses salted so this evil won\'t return for a thousand years.\n\nMy parents are Republicans and it has driven a wedge between us.  They call me a \'lib\' because it is the most powerful insult they know.  I go to their house and the right wing news is inescapable, Limbaugh, Hannity, The Five, Hannity again, it\'s just endless.  They talk endlessly about the Deep State and Obama\'s birth certificate and Hillary\'s emails and Comey being on the take.  They think black people are going to sneak up behind them and play the knockout game.  My dad just bought a gun.  They think I\'m crazy, and I feel like when I moved away from home, I left a cult.

Hands down. After that comes non-violence and ending homelessness. If given the choice between ending  violence and ending homophobia, I would end homophobia.\n\nBut I do think there is a big difference between LGB and T. The first three are sexual preference, and final is gender identity. I think that no laws should discriminate on the basis of sexual preference or gender identity, but I am not sure that the government CAN solve the problems faced by trans people. I can't think of any legislation to introduce or repeal that would help them, that I wouldn't also want to extend to everyone else."", 'Yeah, tbh I\'ve talked to my sister on this and we\'ve agreed the cabinets a bit fucked right now.

Now to the good shit.\n\n*You have no idea*. I\'ll let you in a couple secrets you might not know. First, most of us think he is a boob, excluding the minority of supporters. Second, to let you know how we feel about the whole thing and how good we almost had it during the elections two candidates were being groomed for president and vice \\(whoever wasn\'t the primary would become vice\\). They were Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson. One a very successful businesswoman \\(I was for her\\) and the other a former neurosurgeon. Both of them respected politicians and deserving of leadership roles. And we ended up with what we got because he drew the most attention and was more entertaining. Imagine going from Obama to Al Gore \\(someone else idk\\) and you\'ve got how we feel.\n\nInstead of Progressives I prefer to call them Diversity Democrats; has a nicer ring to it. But that\'s just me. Anyway in terms of in\\-fighting it\'s mostly between us and the president, quarrels between commentators most notably Ben Shapiro and Milo Yiannopoulos. On the note of liberal moderates it is interesting to see people like Brett Weinstein and Christina Hoff Summers speaking along side other right wing commentators and engaging in reasonable conversation. If I\'m being completely honest I hope more people get behind them and that way of thinking because it was them that convinced me to take this stance on how the sides interact.\n\nAs for Trump, I can\'t speak for all of us, however it seems like anytime he says something stupid we pretty much say, ""Of course he did. Why wouldn\'t he?"". All I can really say is don\'t trust what you see on the news as what we think. 24 hour news stations \\(regardless of political stance\\) got us here.\n\nAs for the corruption and investigation, I can only speak for myself as everyone got their own opinion on this. Prior to his presidency, I knew about how corrupt his business practices were, especially how he ran competing construction companies out of business in New York. I like that the FBI is doing is taking this seriously and I will trust their judgment. Takes a real patriot to point out whats wrong with an office especially when the FBI is majority Republican.\n\nAs for the future, I don\'t have a damn clue what\'s gonna happen in 2020.
