Drum mags are notorious for jamming often (several times in a single magazine, which is why he military doesn‚Äôt use them).\n\nBan assault weapons:\nAn ‚Äúassault weapon‚Äù as used by gun control advocates is a misnomer.

They also have narrower lower receivers (the part legally recognized as the gun), meaning you can‚Äôt fit a military automatic sear into it. So gun control advocates needed to redefine what assault weapon meant.\n\nSo in response, the Clinton Ban (1994-2004) banned:\nSemiautomatic rifles with detachable magazines with 2 or more features:\n\nForegrip (a piece of plastic you can hold onto)\n\nPistol grip (another piece of plastic you hold onto)\n\nBayonet lug (a metal piece that allows you to mount a knife onto the barrel without duct tape)\n\nGrenade launcher mount (slots and cuts in the gun that allow you to mount a grenade launcher, which are already restricted, without duct tape\n\nThreaded barrel which can mount a flashhider (this device largely just keeps dirt from blowing into your face while firing prone.

However, the gun is still loud, you hear the gun shot and the bullet breaking the sound barrier)\n\nJust another fun fact about the Clinton Ban, overall rifle deaths declined after the ban expired.\n\n\n\nBut looking over their policies, even presuming the ‚Äúworked‚Äù, none of them would have stopped shootings like Virginia Tech, Columbine (which happened during the Clinton Ban), Santa Fe, YouTube, and so on.\n\n\n\nI‚Äôm not saying what they went through means nothing, it‚Äôs terrible to lose people like that, but it would seem gun free zones don‚Äôt work, and that relying on the police alone will fail you (jut like it did at Parkland).\n\n\n']",democrats,647781,House Democrats Offer Internships For Students Affected By Gun Violence,2

And the worst part is, we now have Dems that felt compelled to oppose the legislation - legislation they knew was needed - because they fear the ignorant fury spewed from the fringe corners of the party.

Pp. 2‚Äì53.\n\n> (a) The Amendment‚Äôs prefatory clause announces a purpose, but does not limit or expand the scope of the second part, the operative clause. The operative clause‚Äôs text and history demonstrate that it connotes an individual right to keep and bear arms. Pp. 2‚Äì22.\n\n>(b) The prefatory clause comports with the Court‚Äôs interpretation of the operative clause. The ‚Äúmilitia‚Äù comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. The Antifederalists feared that the Federal Government would disarm the people in order to disable this citizens‚Äô militia, enabling a politicized standing army or a select militia to rule. The response was to deny Congress power to abridge the ancient right of individuals to keep and bear arms, so that the ideal of a citizens‚Äô militia would be preserved. Pp. 22‚Äì28.\n\n> (c) The Court‚Äôs interpretation is confirmed by analogous arms-bearing rights in state constitutions that preceded and immediately followed the Second Amendment. Pp. 28‚Äì30.\n\n> (d) The Second Amendment‚Äôs drafting history, while of dubious interpretive worth, reveals three state Second Amendment proposals that unequivocally referred to an individual right to bear arms. Pp. 30‚Äì32.\n\n> (e) Interpretation of the Second Amendment by scholars, courts and legislators, from immediately after its ratification through the late 19th century also supports the Court‚Äôs conclusion. Pp. 32‚Äì47.\n\n> (f) None of the Court‚Äôs precedents forecloses the Court‚Äôs interpretation. Neither United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542, nor Presser v. Illinois, 116 U. S. 252, refutes the individual-rights interpretation. United States v. Miller, 307 U. S. 174, does not limit the right to keep and bear arms to militia purposes, but rather limits the type of weapon to which the right applies to those used by the militia, i.e., those in common use for lawful purposes.\n\n> (2) **Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose**: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues. The Court‚Äôs opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. Miller‚Äôs holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those ‚Äúin common use at the time‚Äù finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons. Pp. 54‚Äì56.\n\n> (3) The handgun ban and the trigger-lock requirement (as applied to self-defense) violate the Second Amendment. The District‚Äôs total ban on handgun possession in the home amounts to a prohibition on an entire class of ‚Äúarms‚Äù that Americans overwhelmingly choose for the lawful purpose of self-defense. Under any of the standards of scrutiny the Court has applied to enumerated constitutional rights, this prohibition ‚Äì in the place where the importance of the lawful defense of self, family, and property is most acute ‚Äì would fail constitutional muster. Similarly, the requirement that any lawful firearm in the home be disassembled or bound by a trigger lock makes it impossible for citizens to use arms for the core lawful purpose of self-defense and is hence unconstitutional. Because Heller conceded at oral argument that the D.C. licensing law is permissible if it is not enforced arbitrarily and capriciously, the Court assumes that a license will satisfy his prayer for relief and does not address the licensing requirement. Assuming he is not disqualified from exercising Second Amendment rights, the District must permit Heller to register his handgun and must issue him a license to carry it in the home.

', 'Only 4 of those involved AR-15s, the rest involved handguns (as did sandy hook, with both rifle and handgun, and Pulse he an MPX, which is a 9mm carbine, not an AR-15 as the media had reported) Overall, only 9 shootings involved civilian AR-15s ( which combined are still lower than the casualty count of the Oklahoma City Bombing) compared to the dozens involving handguns.\n\nAlso, San Bernardino occurred in California, a state with an ongoing assault weapon ban (FYI it is illegal to buy a gun out of state and bring it across state lines). And Columbine happened during the assault weapon ban. Additionally, the Texas University Sniper, YouTube, Virginia Tech, or Santa Fe shooters wouldn‚Äôt have been impacted by said ‚Äúassault weapons‚Äù* ban as they didn‚Äôt use any.\n \nAlso, in the 10 years during the assault weapon ban, there were just as many shootings as there were  in the 10 years before the ban. And AR-15s have been available in the US for civilians since 1963, which was 6 years before the military adopted them as standard issue. And the first shooting involving a civilian AR-15 wouldn‚Äôt be until 2013\n\n\nhttps://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/\n\n\n*assault rifle is often defined as semi automatic rifle win a detachable magazine and 2 of the following:\nForegrip -a piece of hollow plastic you can eat you hand on, literally changing no mechanica function\n\nPistol grip- same as above\n\nBayonet lug- a small block that allows for attachment of a bayonet (yes the knife on the barrel )\n\nMovable stock- specifically one that does not require tools to adjust, under the idea that the wild be to concealed other wise.

This is largely due to the term ‚Äúassault rifle‚Äù being stretched from the original meaning. Originally, assault rifle meant an intermediate cartridge (bigger thanks handgun round but smaller than a rifle‚Äôs) in a seedy fire rifle (can switch between semi and full auto). Because civilian AR-15‚Äôs aren‚Äôt sect fire, the term had to be stretched, which is what had led to ‚Äúloopholes‚Äù on what is and isn‚Äôt an assault weapon.

Wants to bring back county gun boards for concealed carry permits and give them more discretion.\n\nFollowing is from his website.\n\nGun Safety\n\nAs a new father, I‚Äôm learning that you always worry about your child. But when you send them off to school, you shouldn‚Äôt have to worry they will fall victim to gun violence. But that story is now all too common in America, from mass shootings in places like Aurora to Kalamazoo and Parkland. But mass shootings are only part of the story ‚Äì in Detroit, where I was Health Commissioner, death by homicide is the most common cause of death among young men aged 12-35. From 2008-2013, over 6,000 Michiganders were killed by gun violence ‚Äì making it deadlier than traffic fatalities. And Michigan is also not immune to the epidemic of mass shooters. In 2016, a mentally unstable man who never should have possessed a gun went on a shooting rampage in Kalamazoo, killing six people and 2 others injured.\n\nClearly, gun violence is a national epidemic. Enough is enough.\n\nThe time is long overdue to treat this as the public health issue it is. As Governor of Michigan, I won‚Äôt stop working until no parent has to bury her child. Too many elected officials are scared of a corporate gun lobby that is more concerned with making profits for gun manufacturers than promoting responsible gun ownership. I will never take a dime from the gun lobby. I am beholden to no one but the people of Michigan, and I will work for common-sense steps to reduce gun violence and keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn‚Äôt have them, like domestic abusers and violent criminals.\n\nHere are my commitments to make Michigan a safer and more responsible state:\n\n1. Prohibit the sale or possession of ‚Äúweapons of war,‚Äù large capacity magazines, and any modifiers that increase fire rate. Growing up, I spent time with my family in Gratiot and Montcalm County - I came to respect Michigan hunting culture and tradition. My own uncle even learned how to prepare the venison he‚Äôd hunt halal so that his Muslim family members could also enjoy it. However, we must recognize that military-style assault weapons like the AR-15 ‚Äì the weapon of choice for mass shooters ‚Äì are not required to take down a buck. These weapons of war are meant for one thing: killing people during war. For that reason, these weapons and any accessories meant to increase their killing ability should be banned from sale in Michigan.\n\n2. Close background check loopholes. Currently, Michigan law does not require background checks for sales at gun shows, by private sellers, and for the sale of firearms other than handguns. As Governor, I will support background checks for all gun sales, including the sale of long guns. This could be achieved by expanding the current purchase-to-permit system to cover handguns and long guns, so that purchase permits are required to buy any type of guns from private sellers.\n\n3. Include domestic abusers in Michigan‚Äôs prohibited purchaser provisions. The presence of a firearm in a Domestic Violence situation makes it 5 times more likely a woman will be murdered. In fact, over half of mass shooter incidents involve the killer shooting intimate partners or other family members, including their children. Currently, Michigan law is incredibly weak when it comes to prohibiting convicted domestic abusers from purchasing or possessing guns. Common sense legislation to prevent domestic abusers from obtaining firearms must do all of the following:\n\n    Prohibit individuals convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors from possessing or purchasing firearms;\n    Require courts to notify individuals convicted of domestic abuse that they are no longer allowed to possess ammunition or firearms;\n    Require the surrender of firearms or ammunition by individuals convicted of domestic abuse;\n    Require law enforcement to remove firearms from the scene of a domestic violence incident.\n\n4. Require the Michigan State Police and local law enforcement to disarm individuals who become prohibited purchasers after purchasing a weapon, being issued a handgun purchase license, or receiving a concealed carry permit. Federal law does not require licensed dealers to conduct a background check if the purchaser presents a state permit to purchase or possess firearms that meet certain conditions. Thus, any Michigander with a handgun purchase license or a concealed pistol license that was issued on or after November 22, 2005 are exempt from the federal background check requirement. This means that people who have become ineligible to possess firearms after getting these licenses may still be able to buy weapons without a background check if the state fails to remove these licenses in a timely manner.\n\n5. Reintroduce discretion into the concealed pistol permit process. Michigan is known as a ‚Äúshall issue‚Äù state, meaning that county clerks - the only body authorized to issue concealed pistol permits - are required to issue permits to all qualified applicants. We need to reintroduce discretion into the process so that communities again have the ability to oversee who can carry a concealed weapon. One way this could be done is through a return to ‚Äúcounty gun boards,‚Äù which had the final say over the issuance of concealed carry permits before 2000 in Michigan.\n\nMichigan should also implement a ‚Äúred flag law,‚Äù which would allow family members and law enforcement to seek a court order to temporarily restrict or remove access to guns when a person poses a danger to themselves or others. Mass shooters and people contemplating suicide often display warning signs. Red flag laws allow family members and law enforcement to take action before tragedy occurs.\n\n6. Prohibit the open carry of firearms in public buildings and registered private establishments. Small business owners deserve the right to have a say whether or not their customers may carry a gun openly. Under this new system, business owners could enter their establishments into a state registry if they do not wish to allow open carry. And nobody should be able to carry a weapon onto school grounds.\n', ""Only God or Satan can perform tricks at that level, and why would God want to appoint someone to be Governor, He's God.\n\nNot sure what this Abdul character is up to, but he is no part of the Holy Trinity and he sure as hell is not the next Governor."", ""My local city installed a Fiber optic network that you could pay for access to.

"['Biden?! No. Bernie Sanders! Yes!!!', ""It gives a good shortened synopsis of his recent stump speech which is enthralling and with young professional people in the room he seemed to have them entranced. It was a Bernie speech but somewhat better than Bernie's monotone of outrage. \n   The one difficulty is believing it. The quotes are exactly in the article :; net worth of less than a million -- maybe hard to believe. He does have a Foundation. He's known to say some brocaded stories in the past but he touched on that little too - the myth of him coming from a blue collar household. But he is funny and lies a lot less than Republicans in general. For me the howler in his recent speech is that he discovered there is this huge gap in incomes about 2 years ago!! Come on, Joe! Bernie's been talking about it for 40 years! Warren, for 15 years . Quite a spell he wove though. "", ""I love Biden, but I have two major concerns about him.  One, he's closely connected to Obama, having served in his administration, and we all know that Obama's possibly the only person the Republicans hate more than Hillary.  Two, he'll be 78 by the time the 2020 winner takes office."", 'Conservatives dream of Biden running for office. ']","['I believe the less than a million number.

Nothing I'd love more than for a real Democrat to take his seat in November."", ""> One, he's closely connected to Obama, having served in his administration, and we all know that Obama's possibly the only person the Republicans hate more than Hillary.\n\nSee, I see that as a net electoral strength.  For Democrats, Obama remains a powerful and energizing presence.  Biden's close association to Obama is a major portion of the reason that he leads the potential field in every poll.  FWIW, while I know Obama will be happy to play whatever role as surrogate the eventual nominee asks for, but for Biden?  Let's just say [he's a big fan](https://www.npr.org/2017/01/12/509545778/in-surprise-send-off-president-obama-awards-biden-presidential-medal-of-freedom), and that kind of authentic, heartfelt admiration is infectious.\n\nMeanwhile, that association doesn't seem to have rubbed off on Joe with republicans.  While a few months old, a quick search found [this poll](http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2018/images/01/23/rel1e.-.2020.pdf) that pegs Biden at -17 with voters that lean republican.  Compared to Obama hanging around -70 with those voters at the end of his term, or Clinton's -80 shortly before the election that's a substantial boost.  Hell, Bernie Sanders sits with almost twice that gap, with a -32 (29/61).\n\nWe're a long way from 2020 and the GOP will undoubtedly do everything they can to change that if Biden runs.  But at least we can be reasonably safe in saying Biden wouldn't be at a disadvantage because of this compared to the rest of the field.\n\n> Two, he'll be 78 by the time the 2020 winner takes office.\n\nAbsolutely, it's a legitimate concern.  In most past campaigns, it would've been a likely deal breaker.  But the GOP opponent in trump would only be 3 1/2 years younger.  And Bernie - perhaps the only serious challenger to Biden for the nomination - is over year older.  Add to that the fact that Biden is rather famously fit for his age and keeps a much healthier lifestyle than either of his septuagenarian challengers and I just don't think there's much area to hit Biden on age.  Especially if (as has been floated) he decided to limit himself to a single term when announcing, possibly with a VP already picked. "", 'Yeah? Who would conservatives hate to run against?\n', 'Don\'t see that. I am not a fan until recently-- despite his age, he\'s adopted much of Bernie\'s ""income inequality"" theme but with a better speech. He\'s been Too Conservative to me in the past but after his recent stirring speeches he\'s a pol\'s pol as well as a populist. A bit too soft on billionaires but then Americans are fairly pro-capitalism even though I am further left -- but I am a minority in that respect. Just getting a popular moderate left guy or woman is enough at this point -- who can deliver a political skill that many newer faces can\'t seem to deliver. The ""pol"" part is not easy to get.

They don‚Äôt see these moments as *evidence* of an unfit president but rather the *defamation* of one. \n\nI used to be friends with a MAGA shmuck who is rather bright (book wise I guess), though lacking common sense in many areas and a bit bigoted though he didn‚Äôt think so. We‚Äôd often have political discussions even before 2016 and though had our difference, could meet in the middle. They used to be constructive conversations until *J* started having a rough go at the end of 14 beginning of 15. By the time Trump splashed onto the scene, there was no getting through. He simply *couldn‚Äôt* acknowledge any negatives honestly, they were nothing‚Äôs for him. \n\nJ was by no means a bad guy, which is a real fucked thing to say following my previous statement, but in his reality he had basically one chance to get himself through school financially speaking. We could all see he was being overly ambitious in his career choice but what young person isn‚Äôt? Like a lot of people I know, he had changed courses a couple times and exhausted his financial aid. After only 3 years in post-secondary he was unable to acquire loans or student aid, to which he blamed ‚Äúthe system‚Äù despite him making horrible and expensive decisions and ultimately not achieving the grades he needed to. \n\nIt was not long after that a populist *billionaire* comes onto the scene preaching to be for the people who wants to *drain the swamp*. That really must have resonated. I hadn‚Äôt talked to him specifically about this, but I imagine he felt stuck at the time and latched onto Trump for all the same reasons you can read about. Ultimately I think he was just desperate. \n\nThe *real issue* I‚Äôm trying to highlight, as I believe was that his friends (myself included) all took the opposition in attacking Trumps character (qualifications and credibility etc etc) as being unfit to honestly represent the American people. *j* eventually became unable to separate the arguments against someone he supported from his own character and just became bitter about everything. His closeted bigotry surely did not help. \n\nHe‚Äôs always had an argumentative personality that had pushed most of his friends away, it‚Äôs just that recently I (one of his long standing friends) realized how truly toxic he became over the years. So while I don‚Äôt think Trump is entirely the reason this guy became an ‚Äúagainst the grain asshole‚Äù as a mutual friend elegantly put it, MAGA was definitely a catalyst and attacking Trumps intelligence is likely a major *micro-factor*. \n\nBut seriously, if the man could just hire an editor and read a prompt. . .\n\n\nEdit: forgot to finish a point.

These were the classifications for projects back during the New Deal:\n\nStructural improvements: bridges, fire lookout towers, service buildings\n\nTransportation: truck trails, minor roads, foot trails and airport landing fields\n\nErosion control: check dams, terracing, and vegetable covering\n\nFlood control: irrigation, drainage, dams, ditching, channel work, riprapping\n\nForest culture: planting trees and shrubs, timber stand improvement, seed collection, nursery work\n\nForest protection: fire prevention, fire pre-suppression, firefighting, insect and disease control\n\nLandscape and recreation: public camp and picnic ground development, lake and pond site clearing and development\n\nRange: stock driveways, elimination of predatory animals (and removal of invasive species)\n\nWildlife: stream improvement, fish stocking, food and cover planting\n\nMiscellaneous: emergency work, surveys, mosquito control\n\nCan also add species monitoring, training them in basic spottings of wildlife and then tracking that data to detect possibly endangered species, where they are being found, etc.\n\n* Farming work in urban areas, rooftop gardens and the like, to address America\'s nutrition problem in poverty stricken areas.\n\n* As an extension of that, management of small community gardens to provide fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\n* Maintenance and cleaning of public areas and government buildings.\n\n* Composting - an area where cities and towns have a lot of room to expand upon.\n\nCommunity projects:\n\n* Keep vacant areas looking nice, maintaining the town\'s image, general landscaping work like that which can be done by anyone.\n\n* Small infrastructure projects modeled again on a New Deal program, the Works Progress Administration. Their projects [still live on](https://livingnewdeal.org/map/) to this day and the same can happen with this to advance society as a whole. \n\n* Managing the program itself on the local levels. Lots of workers must be assigned!\n\n* Managing coworking spaces and incubators to foster a spirit of innovation.\n\n* Construction of simple Green Energy projects to ease society off of fossil fuels and towards renewable energy.\n\n* Establishment and management of ""tool libraries"" and other services that would make it easier for people to carry out routine improvement work, improving the image of the community as a whole.\n\n* Teaching of classes and programs of any sort:\n\n- This includes prison classes, helping to bring inmates back into society as other countries have succeeded in.\n\n* If someone has extraordinary talent, a small-scale program similar to the New Deal\'s Federal Project Number One can be implemented to allow these artists, musicians, poets, playrights, etc. to function. Of course the fruits of that program are still with us today!\n\n* Constructing more small scale playgrounds and managing other areas for kids to hang out to divert them from, say, a gang influenced life or a drug addiction, with the opioid problem being so big across the country.\n\n* Better pedestrian pathways, bike lanes, carpooling programs, and new mass transit bus routes can be added, all of which promote a more sustainable system and cut down on traffic.\n\n* Add more extended school day programs to allow parents to work and be productive while ensuring that kids learn more and there is more time for them to relax during the school day, and...\n\n* Universal Childcare can be implemented taking a major burden off the hands of many members of the working class.\n\n* Teachers in some areas can recieve assistance managing young children or giving special attention to some who are behind the curve. We know they need the help!\n\n* Sports coaches, as part of an established after-school or weekend program, can be added in here and there to supplement hours while still providing a social good, ditto for extending library hours!\n\n* National hospice program for those that have no family members to take care of them and no money to afford a nursing home, workers can help these people perform their basic living tasks at certain scheduled times in the day.\n\n* Assign people to help non-profit organizations that need assistance in helping the community, excempting religious/political groups.\n\n* More assistance for veterans who may be disabled, and disabled people in general.\n\n* Special skills can be utilized. For example a researcher may spend time continuing to advance the public knowledge sphere by continuing their research, or someone trained in mental health may be able to provide counseling services to the depressed(maybe that\'ll help this mass shooting problem!)\n\n* Adminstrative assistance can be provided in terms of paperwork, etc. for those looking to start a small business to foster an entreprenuerial culture.\n\n* Apprenticeships and on-the-job training programs with other public workers, to count towards valuable job experience.\n', ""Likely 2020 candidates?

The first three are sexual preference, and final is gender identity. I think that no laws should discriminate on the basis of sexual preference or gender identity, but I am not sure that the government CAN solve the problems faced by trans people. I can't think of any legislation to introduce or repeal that would help them, that I wouldn't also want to extend to everyone else."", 'Yeah, tbh I\'ve talked to my sister on this and we\'ve agreed the cabinets a bit fucked right now. In fact, most of us think he\'s a boob and I\'ve adopted a kind of ""oh, what now?"" attitude toward the whole thing. ', ""I am not OP, but I just wanted to say: yes, the republicans and especially Pence have a completely shit track record on LGBT. \n\nI think if you're going to do a fair comparison, you'd want to compare someone like Shapiro to NPR. Hannity is more partisan, vitriolic and angry, closer to The Young Turks. NPR is where grandparents tune in in AM radio to hear the news.\n\nI say this as a person who listens to both the NPR Politics Podcast and the Ben Shapiro Show to get my daily dose of news."", '> which of the 2 was the most inflamatory in tone\n\ni would love to see more people consume their news with THIS particular criteria in mind. set aside who\'s ""telling the truth"" or what\'s ""fake news"" and listen to the *tone* and what it\'s trying to accomplish. i know full well when i watch ""full frontal with samantha bee"" that she\'s putting an emotional, inciteful liberal spin on the jokes she\'s telling, i don\'t watch her for facts, i watch her to hear impassioned jokes about what i already know. the daily show also deals in comedy but the tone is less inflammatory, and late night with seth meyers even less so. if people can learn to start telling the difference between ""north and south korean leaders held a summit to discuss a peace treaty"" and ""GOD EMPEROR TRUMP BROKERS MIRACULOUS KOREAN REUNIFICATION DEAL #MAGA"" we\'d be a lot better off as a country and globally.', ""First of all, I am extending an olive branch here, take a breath. I will say this, you are resorting to identity politics and polarizing my side, which is what I want to be rid of on all sides. That said there I'll break down what you said; there is more than the republican party on the right. You've got guys like me who are independent, Libertarians \\(like you mentioned\\), Log cabin republicans, etc. There are plenty of people on the right, including myself, who support economic freedom and smaller government and \\*still\\* support LGBT rights. I'm a personal liberties kind of guy, so long as you are not hurting anyone and are not imposing your beliefs on me you are alright in my book. On the note of broadcasters I could do the same song and dance and point to Buzzfeed, Vox, and MTV on how SJW craziness rules your side and when compared to Ben Shapiro, Stephen Crowder, and Jordan Peterson \\(he's not right wing but we like him a lot\\) and say we are more reasonable and willing to have a conversation. The thing is that I know there are reasonable people on the other side and I just wanted to put my hand up and show same goes for over here as well."", ""Right wing doesn't automatically equate to alt right, and OP doesn't sound very alt right to me."", ""You're good it happens. Although on the topic of alt right I will say this: if right wing politics was a banquet hall of a hundred tables. the alt right would make up \\*at best\\* two tables. We aren't fond of them either. Actually if you go back to Charlottesville it was actually impressive to see how quickly the vast majority of right wingers drew a box around them and told them to gtfo. \\(Excluding the presidents opinions on this one, he's in a camp all his own\\)"", ""Pretty good, thank you! finals next week so I'm using this as a study break."", 'it would be like democrats winning full control but justin bieber is president.\n\n> a lot of Democrats are demanding any candidate pledge to fight for single-payer, but i personally think that\'s both unrealistic and political suicide.\n\nit\'s possible. we got the ACA passed, we just lacked the public option to make it work the way it was supposed to. a lot of democrats aren\'t necessarily using the phrase ""single-payer"" but are calling for ""medicare for all,"" and one of them - beto o\'rourke - is actually consistently outraising ted cruz and getting a lot of press about his candidacy. if we can sort of shunt the ACA into medicare, where eligibility guidelines are expanded and a buy-in option is available to those who don\'t qualify for free, that\'s a big step towards covering everyone, if not cutting out private insurance entirely.', 'My day was great thank you for asking. Now to the good shit.\n\n*You have no idea*. I\'ll let you in a couple secrets you might not know. First, most of us think he is a boob, excluding the minority of supporters. Second, to let you know how we feel about the whole thing and how good we almost had it during the elections two candidates were being groomed for president and vice \\(whoever wasn\'t the primary would become vice\\). They were Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson. One a very successful businesswoman \\(I was for her\\) and the other a former neurosurgeon. Both of them respected politicians and deserving of leadership roles. And we ended up with what we got because he drew the most attention and was more entertaining. Imagine going from Obama to Al Gore \\(someone else idk\\) and you\'ve got how we feel.\n\nInstead of Progressives I prefer to call them Diversity Democrats; has a nicer ring to it. But that\'s just me. Anyway in terms of in\\-fighting it\'s mostly between us and the president, quarrels between commentators most notably Ben Shapiro and Milo Yiannopoulos. On the note of liberal moderates it is interesting to see people like Brett Weinstein and Christina Hoff Summers speaking along side other right wing commentators and engaging in reasonable conversation. If I\'m being completely honest I hope more people get behind them and that way of thinking because it was them that convinced me to take this stance on how the sides interact.\n\nAs for Trump, I can\'t speak for all of us, however it seems like anytime he says something stupid we pretty much say, ""Of course he did. Why wouldn\'t he?"". All I can really say is don\'t trust what you see on the news as what we think. 24 hour news stations \\(regardless of political stance\\) got us here.\n\nAs for the corruption and investigation, I can only speak for myself as everyone got their own opinion on this. Prior to his presidency, I knew about how corrupt his business practices were, especially how he ran competing construction companies out of business in New York. I like that the FBI is doing is taking this seriously and I will trust their judgment. Takes a real patriot to point out whats wrong with an office especially when the FBI is majority Republican.\n\nAs for the future, I don\'t have a damn clue what\'s gonna happen in 2020. I just started exploring my political beliefs two years ago. Just my luck it was in this climate.']",democrats,2531646,Take me out of my Right-Wing bubble.,67
