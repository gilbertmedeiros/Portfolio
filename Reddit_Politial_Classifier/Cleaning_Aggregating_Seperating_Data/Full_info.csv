I didn‚Äôt vote for Bernie Sanders. \n\nYes, we‚Äôre lucky that progressives of past generations helped create a society in which weirdos like me with wild ideas can exist and have a platform. Our society, greatly aided by technology, has changed a lot in just the last 20 years. The way we consume information and discuss that info is much different. My generation understands this and by golly we‚Äôre using it and making real change! Young people are more aware and better educated about sociopolitical issues than ever before (thank you internet!). And we‚Äôre breaking norms by spreading ideas and taking action via this technology. No, protest isn‚Äôt new, but how young people are learning about and recognizing the multitude of ways our country could and should improve and change, and then becoming unlikely activists, is happening more and more, and we‚Äôre getting things done faster and faster, impatient of the pace of progress of the past.\n\nOur generation is just getting started, so not sure what you mean by ‚ÄúYou are the ones that created it and will have to live with it.‚Äù We have to live with the consequences of every decision made by previous generations.

And we‚Äôre just getting started.\n\nI don‚Äôt understand why you, and other older folks, seem to find that so problematic.

The Antifederalists feared that the Federal Government would disarm the people in order to disable this citizens‚Äô militia, enabling a politicized standing army or a select militia to rule.

S. 174, does not limit the right to keep and bear arms to militia purposes, but rather limits the type of weapon to which the right applies to those used by the militia, i.e., those in common use for lawful purposes.\n\n> (2) **Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose**: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues. The Court‚Äôs opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.

The District‚Äôs total ban on handgun possession in the home amounts to a prohibition on an entire class of ‚Äúarms‚Äù that Americans overwhelmingly choose for the lawful purpose of self-defense. Under any of the standards of scrutiny the Court has applied to enumerated constitutional rights, this prohibition ‚Äì in the place where the importance of the lawful defense of self, family, and property is most acute ‚Äì would fail constitutional muster. Similarly, the requirement that any lawful firearm in the home be disassembled or bound by a trigger lock makes it impossible for citizens to use arms for the core lawful purpose of self-defense and is hence unconstitutional. Because Heller conceded at oral argument that the D.C. licensing law is permissible if it is not enforced arbitrarily and capriciously, the Court assumes that a license will satisfy his prayer for relief and does not address the licensing requirement.

That allocation places no governmental obstacle in the path of a woman wishing to terminate her pregnancy, and leaves her with the same choices as if the Government had chosen not to fund family planning services at all.

The fact that most Title X clients may be effectively precluded by indigency from seeing a health care provider for abortion-related services does not affect the outcome here, since the financial constraints on such a woman's ability to enjoy the full range of constitutionally protected freedom of choice are the product not of governmental restrictions, but of her indigency.\n""]",democrats,1234632,The Trump administration plans to announce on Friday a new policy barring Planned Parenthood and other reproductive health organizations from providing or mentioning abortions at any facility that receives federal family planning funds,3,62,2120,235

Wants to bring back county gun boards for concealed carry permits and give them more discretion.\n\nFollowing is from his website.\n\nGun Safety\n\nAs a new father, I‚Äôm learning that you always worry about your child. But when you send them off to school, you shouldn‚Äôt have to worry they will fall victim to gun violence. But that story is now all too common in America, from mass shootings in places like Aurora to Kalamazoo and Parkland. But mass shootings are only part of the story ‚Äì in Detroit, where I was Health Commissioner, death by homicide is the most common cause of death among young men aged 12-35. From 2008-2013, over 6,000 Michiganders were killed by gun violence ‚Äì making it deadlier than traffic fatalities. And Michigan is also not immune to the epidemic of mass shooters. In 2016, a mentally unstable man who never should have possessed a gun went on a shooting rampage in Kalamazoo, killing six people and 2 others injured.\n\nClearly, gun violence is a national epidemic. Enough is enough.\n\nThe time is long overdue to treat this as the public health issue it is. As Governor of Michigan, I won‚Äôt stop working until no parent has to bury her child. Too many elected officials are scared of a corporate gun lobby that is more concerned with making profits for gun manufacturers than promoting responsible gun ownership. I will never take a dime from the gun lobby. I am beholden to no one but the people of Michigan, and I will work for common-sense steps to reduce gun violence and keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn‚Äôt have them, like domestic abusers and violent criminals.\n\nHere are my commitments to make Michigan a safer and more responsible state:\n\n1. Prohibit the sale or possession of ‚Äúweapons of war,‚Äù large capacity magazines, and any modifiers that increase fire rate. Growing up, I spent time with my family in Gratiot and Montcalm County - I came to respect Michigan hunting culture and tradition. My own uncle even learned how to prepare the venison he‚Äôd hunt halal so that his Muslim family members could also enjoy it. However, we must recognize that military-style assault weapons like the AR-15 ‚Äì the weapon of choice for mass shooters ‚Äì are not required to take down a buck. These weapons of war are meant for one thing: killing people during war. For that reason, these weapons and any accessories meant to increase their killing ability should be banned from sale in Michigan.\n\n2. Close background check loopholes. Currently, Michigan law does not require background checks for sales at gun shows, by private sellers, and for the sale of firearms other than handguns. As Governor, I will support background checks for all gun sales, including the sale of long guns. This could be achieved by expanding the current purchase-to-permit system to cover handguns and long guns, so that purchase permits are required to buy any type of guns from private sellers.\n\n3. Include domestic abusers in Michigan‚Äôs prohibited purchaser provisions. The presence of a firearm in a Domestic Violence situation makes it 5 times more likely a woman will be murdered. In fact, over half of mass shooter incidents involve the killer shooting intimate partners or other family members, including their children. Currently, Michigan law is incredibly weak when it comes to prohibiting convicted domestic abusers from purchasing or possessing guns. Common sense legislation to prevent domestic abusers from obtaining firearms must do all of the following:\n\n    Prohibit individuals convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors from possessing or purchasing firearms;\n    Require courts to notify individuals convicted of domestic abuse that they are no longer allowed to possess ammunition or firearms;\n    Require the surrender of firearms or ammunition by individuals convicted of domestic abuse;\n    Require law enforcement to remove firearms from the scene of a domestic violence incident.\n\n4. Require the Michigan State Police and local law enforcement to disarm individuals who become prohibited purchasers after purchasing a weapon, being issued a handgun purchase license, or receiving a concealed carry permit. Federal law does not require licensed dealers to conduct a background check if the purchaser presents a state permit to purchase or possess firearms that meet certain conditions. Thus, any Michigander with a handgun purchase license or a concealed pistol license that was issued on or after November 22, 2005 are exempt from the federal background check requirement. This means that people who have become ineligible to possess firearms after getting these licenses may still be able to buy weapons without a background check if the state fails to remove these licenses in a timely manner.\n\n5. Reintroduce discretion into the concealed pistol permit process. Michigan is known as a ‚Äúshall issue‚Äù state, meaning that county clerks - the only body authorized to issue concealed pistol permits - are required to issue permits to all qualified applicants. We need to reintroduce discretion into the process so that communities again have the ability to oversee who can carry a concealed weapon. One way this could be done is through a return to ‚Äúcounty gun boards,‚Äù which had the final say over the issuance of concealed carry permits before 2000 in Michigan.\n\nMichigan should also implement a ‚Äúred flag law,‚Äù which would allow family members and law enforcement to seek a court order to temporarily restrict or remove access to guns when a person poses a danger to themselves or others. Mass shooters and people contemplating suicide often display warning signs. Red flag laws allow family members and law enforcement to take action before tragedy occurs.\n\n6. Prohibit the open carry of firearms in public buildings and registered private establishments. Small business owners deserve the right to have a say whether or not their customers may carry a gun openly. Under this new system, business owners could enter their establishments into a state registry if they do not wish to allow open carry. And nobody should be able to carry a weapon onto school grounds.\n', ""Only God or Satan can perform tricks at that level, and why would God want to appoint someone to be Governor, He's God.\n\nNot sure what this Abdul character is up to, but he is no part of the Holy Trinity and he sure as hell is not the next Governor."", ""My local city installed a Fiber optic network that you could pay for access to.

"['Biden?! No. Bernie Sanders! Yes!!!', ""It gives a good shortened synopsis of his recent stump speech which is enthralling and with young professional people in the room he seemed to have them entranced. It was a Bernie speech but somewhat better than Bernie's monotone of outrage. \n   The one difficulty is believing it. The quotes are exactly in the article :; net worth of less than a million -- maybe hard to believe. He does have a Foundation. He's known to say some brocaded stories in the past but he touched on that little too - the myth of him coming from a blue collar household. But he is funny and lies a lot less than Republicans in general. For me the howler in his recent speech is that he discovered there is this huge gap in incomes about 2 years ago!! Come on, Joe! Bernie's been talking about it for 40 years! Warren, for 15 years . Quite a spell he wove though. "", ""I love Biden, but I have two major concerns about him.  One, he's closely connected to Obama, having served in his administration, and we all know that Obama's possibly the only person the Republicans hate more than Hillary.  Two, he'll be 78 by the time the 2020 winner takes office."", 'Conservatives dream of Biden running for office. ']","['I believe the less than a million number.

Anytime Bernie opens his mouth, it makes me want to cringe.  Nothing I'd love more than for a real Democrat to take his seat in November."", ""> One, he's closely connected to Obama, having served in his administration, and we all know that Obama's possibly the only person the Republicans hate more than Hillary.\n\nSee, I see that as a net electoral strength.  For Democrats, Obama remains a powerful and energizing presence.  Biden's close association to Obama is a major portion of the reason that he leads the potential field in every poll.  FWIW, while I know Obama will be happy to play whatever role as surrogate the eventual nominee asks for, but for Biden?  Let's just say [he's a big fan](https://www.npr.org/2017/01/12/509545778/in-surprise-send-off-president-obama-awards-biden-presidential-medal-of-freedom), and that kind of authentic, heartfelt admiration is infectious.\n\nMeanwhile, that association doesn't seem to have rubbed off on Joe with republicans.  While a few months old, a quick search found [this poll](http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2018/images/01/23/rel1e.-.2020.pdf) that pegs Biden at -17 with voters that lean republican.  Compared to Obama hanging around -70 with those voters at the end of his term, or Clinton's -80 shortly before the election that's a substantial boost.  Hell, Bernie Sanders sits with almost twice that gap, with a -32 (29/61).\n\nWe're a long way from 2020 and the GOP will undoubtedly do everything they can to change that if Biden runs.  But at least we can be reasonably safe in saying Biden wouldn't be at a disadvantage because of this compared to the rest of the field.\n\n> Two, he'll be 78 by the time the 2020 winner takes office.\n\nAbsolutely, it's a legitimate concern.  In most past campaigns, it would've been a likely deal breaker.  But the GOP opponent in trump would only be 3 1/2 years younger.  And Bernie - perhaps the only serious challenger to Biden for the nomination - is over year older.  Add to that the fact that Biden is rather famously fit for his age and keeps a much healthier lifestyle than either of his septuagenarian challengers and I just don't think there's much area to hit Biden on age.  Especially if (as has been floated) he decided to limit himself to a single term when announcing, possibly with a VP already picked. "", 'Yeah? Who would conservatives hate to run against?\n', 'Don\'t see that. I am not a fan until recently-- despite his age, he\'s adopted much of Bernie\'s ""income inequality"" theme but with a better speech. He\'s been Too Conservative to me in the past but after his recent stirring speeches he\'s a pol\'s pol as well as a populist. A bit too soft on billionaires but then Americans are fairly pro-capitalism even though I am further left -- but I am a minority in that respect. Just getting a popular moderate left guy or woman is enough at this point -- who can deliver a political skill that many newer faces can\'t seem to deliver. The ""pol"" part is not easy to get.

They don‚Äôt see these moments as *evidence* of an unfit president but rather the *defamation* of one. \n\nI used to be friends with a MAGA shmuck who is rather bright (book wise I guess), though lacking common sense in many areas and a bit bigoted though he didn‚Äôt think so. We‚Äôd often have political discussions even before 2016 and though had our difference, could meet in the middle. They used to be constructive conversations until *J* started having a rough go at the end of 14 beginning of 15. By the time Trump splashed onto the scene, there was no getting through. He simply *couldn‚Äôt* acknowledge any negatives honestly, they were nothing‚Äôs for him. \n\nJ was by no means a bad guy, which is a real fucked thing to say following my previous statement, but in his reality he had basically one chance to get himself through school financially speaking. We could all see he was being overly ambitious in his career choice but what young person isn‚Äôt? Like a lot of people I know, he had changed courses a couple times and exhausted his financial aid. After only 3 years in post-secondary he was unable to acquire loans or student aid, to which he blamed ‚Äúthe system‚Äù despite him making horrible and expensive decisions and ultimately not achieving the grades he needed to. \n\nIt was not long after that a populist *billionaire* comes onto the scene preaching to be for the people who wants to *drain the swamp*. That really must have resonated. I hadn‚Äôt talked to him specifically about this, but I imagine he felt stuck at the time and latched onto Trump for all the same reasons you can read about. Ultimately I think he was just desperate. \n\nThe *real issue* I‚Äôm trying to highlight, as I believe was that his friends (myself included) all took the opposition in attacking Trumps character (qualifications and credibility etc etc) as being unfit to honestly represent the American people. *j* eventually became unable to separate the arguments against someone he supported from his own character and just became bitter about everything. His closeted bigotry surely did not help. \n\nHe‚Äôs always had an argumentative personality that had pushed most of his friends away, it‚Äôs just that recently I (one of his long standing friends) realized how truly toxic he became over the years. So while I don‚Äôt think Trump is entirely the reason this guy became an ‚Äúagainst the grain asshole‚Äù as a mutual friend elegantly put it, MAGA was definitely a catalyst and attacking Trumps intelligence is likely a major *micro-factor*. \n\nBut seriously, if the man could just hire an editor and read a prompt. . .\n\n\nEdit: forgot to finish a point.

Their projects [still live on](https://livingnewdeal.org/map/) to this day and the same can happen with this to advance society as a whole. \n\n* Managing the program itself on the local levels. Lots of workers must be assigned!\n\n* Managing coworking spaces and incubators to foster a spirit of innovation.\n\n* Construction of simple Green Energy projects to ease society off of fossil fuels and towards renewable energy.\n\n* Establishment and management of ""tool libraries"" and other services that would make it easier for people to carry out routine improvement work, improving the image of the community as a whole.\n\n* Teaching of classes and programs of any sort:\n\n- This includes prison classes, helping to bring inmates back into society as other countries have succeeded in.\n\n* If someone has extraordinary talent, a small-scale program similar to the New Deal\'s Federal Project Number One can be implemented to allow these artists, musicians, poets, playrights, etc. to function. Of course the fruits of that program are still with us today!\n\n* Constructing more small scale playgrounds and managing other areas for kids to hang out to divert them from, say, a gang influenced life or a drug addiction, with the opioid problem being so big across the country.\n\n* Better pedestrian pathways, bike lanes, carpooling programs, and new mass transit bus routes can be added, all of which promote a more sustainable system and cut down on traffic.\n\n* Add more extended school day programs to allow parents to work and be productive while ensuring that kids learn more and there is more time for them to relax during the school day, and...\n\n* Universal Childcare can be implemented taking a major burden off the hands of many members of the working class.\n\n* Teachers in some areas can recieve assistance managing young children or giving special attention to some who are behind the curve. We know they need the help!\n\n* Sports coaches, as part of an established after-school or weekend program, can be added in here and there to supplement hours while still providing a social good, ditto for extending library hours!\n\n* National hospice program for those that have no family members to take care of them and no money to afford a nursing home, workers can help these people perform their basic living tasks at certain scheduled times in the day.\n\n* Assign people to help non-profit organizations that need assistance in helping the community, excempting religious/political groups.\n\n* More assistance for veterans who may be disabled, and disabled people in general.\n\n* Special skills can be utilized. For example a researcher may spend time continuing to advance the public knowledge sphere by continuing their research, or someone trained in mental health may be able to provide counseling services to the depressed(maybe that\'ll help this mass shooting problem!)\n\n* Adminstrative assistance can be provided in terms of paperwork, etc. for those looking to start a small business to foster an entreprenuerial culture.\n\n* Apprenticeships and on-the-job training programs with other public workers, to count towards valuable job experience.\n', ""Likely 2020 candidates?

In most people‚Äôs lives there‚Äôs a situation where you‚Äôre backed into a corner with no way out. You can‚Äôt ask someone to deal with it for you. Whether it‚Äôs having to sleep in a car for a month, being unemployed for an extended period of time. Have debt collectors calling you. Have no transportation to work. \n\nThose are experiences that mold a person. They‚Äôre horrible but give a person perspective on life.\n\nTrump has never had to work his way up. He‚Äôs never had to grind out the shitty jobs that get your foot in the door. Doing that shitty work makes you see that it‚Äôs the low guys who determine how well an operation functions. \n\nI just think of the picture of Obama fist bumping the custodian in the WH. I‚Äôve worked as a janitor/custodian when that picture was released. It showed me a lot. Obama isn‚Äôt too good for anyone and recognizes those people allow him to not spend his time dealing with that stuff. \n\nTrump stiffs his contractors. \n\nObama was not a perfect man. He made decisions that will be debated on for many years. But as the face of the country, growing up in a one parent home, beat the odds, he‚Äôs charismatic. Articulate, intelligent, and he always wanted to do the right thing. A devoted husband and father, a loving family, a sense of humor, takes the high road, cares deeply about the country. Obama told Trump not to hire Flynn, not because of a vendetta or to influence Trump but because Flynn would be a liability in that spot and it wouldn‚Äôt be good for the country. \n\nObama was someone that was a personification of the American Dream. He was what many of us aspire to be. Overcome our misfortunes, work hard, care, love, experience, learn, listen, optimistic. Obama didn‚Äôt need to compare himself to others for reassurance. He was self confident because he understood there are too many variables that it‚Äôs useless. The crisis‚Äô are unique for every one. \n\nUltimately though, Obama respected others and understanding of others. He got frustrated at times, he would criticize the other party for games they were playing. But he never told people they don‚Äôt love America because they disagree with me. He understood the reasoning behind not standing for the national anthem,(I believe he disagreed with it but support their right to do it). He didn‚Äôt whine about his media coverage. He never called for a reporter to be fired because of a mistake that later was corrected. \n\nHe brought in people he disagreed with, he listened to them. He brought in people with expertise in their field to run that section. He brought in people who were not ethical nightmares. \n\nObama‚Äôs worst qualities as a human and or leader and still better than Trumps best qualities.

It kind of puts everything else on the backburner."", ""Former Republican then Libertarian now Democrat. LGBT rights is the most important issue at this point for me. You support LGBT rights too? Your party doesn't. For example in my state our governor, a Democrat in a very red state, issued an executive order protecting LGBT citizens and the Republican legislators killed it. This happens all over the country, just look at the things Pence did in Indiana. You may be for LGBT rights but your party as a whole on average is hiding behind religion to discriminate against LGBT citizens.\n\nAnd the Republican party is the so-called moral majority and religious-right. Yet they turn a blind eye to all of Trump's sexism and racism. The talking heads on the right spin this and side step it, but if Obama did one of the immoral/irreligious things Trump has done, the right would keep this on the top of their agenda for months nay years. Republicans hide behind religion and morality as a utilitarian act only when it is convenient.\n\nHere's something you can try to see if the right or left is being the most fair. Spend a week listening to Hannity/Limbaugh/Savage/etc on the radio. Then spend a week listening to NPR on the radio. Now ask yourself which of the 2 was the most inflamatory in tone and to what extent was this so in comparison to the other, and which of the 2 were the most objective and calm in tone and to what extent was this so in comparison to the other. Both sides are at fault but both sides are not equally at fault.\n\nThis is why I left the Republican party. Have a nice day!"", 'Whatis it that drew you to the alt right in particular?\n\nEdit: misread the title sorry', 'My day was ok, how about yours?', 'Actually, I\'m curious how you\'re doing - I can\'t imagine what it must be like to have your ""side"" win full control of government but have Trump be at the head.  That would be a bit like Democrats winning full control but with Al Sharpton as president (actually, not even that is an extreme enough comparison)\n\nClimate of internal politics - there\'s still a fight between moderates (derisively called ""Corporate Democrats"") and Progressives (for lack of a better label).  I worry that too many people see any compromise as capitulation - for example, a lot of Democrats are demanding any candidate pledge to fight for single-payer, but i personally think that\'s both unrealistic and political suicide.  \n\nTopics of conversation - even 18 months into this, it\'s still just daily amazement at what 40% of this country is willing to accept as normal - the levels of corruption among Trump\'s cabinet and family, the insanely high turnover, the hundreds of government positions that sit empty, the level of narcissist ego-mania, the Twitter outbursts, the contradictions (i.e. attacks his own AG and Sec. of State), the abundant evidence of both collusion and cover-up....and beyond all the true believers who will forgive anything there\'s all those on the Right who just go along with it all with barely a word of protest.  We want to move past being shocked by the daily outrages, but it\'s hard.  \n\nWhat I think is going on with the Right - they know there\'s a good chance they are screwed in 2018 and 2020, so they\'re juicing this presidency for all they can while they can - tax cuts, conservative judges, hawkish foreign policy - I think a lot of Republicans hate where they find themseleves but are willing to hold their nose and exploiut it as much as they can, especially since they have to lock in what they can since they might be out of power for a long while after this.  \n\nAnd my day is great, thanks - yours?', 'Hiya!  Former Republican here, I was a big McCainiac back in 2000 and gradually was alienated from the GOP during the Bush years.  I\'ll never forgive him for his \'illegitimate black baby\' trick he played in South Carolina.\n\nI\'m hanging in there.\n\nClimate seems fine, we\'re in decent spirits, there is a lot of hope, trying to make up for the intense dread that we\'re experiencing.  A lot is riding on 2018.\n\nThe big thing I\'m focused on is the rise of the alt-right.  I live in DC, and we get more than our fair share of white nationalist shitheads trying to cause trouble.  I\'ve seen people outside the White House in Nazi uniforms shouting into bullhorns about gassing Jews, I\'ve torn down several ""It\'s Okay To Be White"" posters, I\'ve taken down flyers for white supremacist meetups with razor blades on the edges to keep people like me from tampering with them.  I even saw and intimidated Richard Spencer when he was leaving a hotel two blocks from my apartment.  I have friends who are living in fear of these people, I have friends who\'ve been beaten by these people.  I hate these people, I want them gone, I want them driven out of power, I want them dead and buried, and the ground above their putrid corpses salted so this evil won\'t return for a thousand years.\n\nMy parents are Republicans and it has driven a wedge between us.  They call me a \'lib\' because it is the most powerful insult they know.  I go to their house and the right wing news is inescapable, Limbaugh, Hannity, The Five, Hannity again, it\'s just endless.  They talk endlessly about the Deep State and Obama\'s birth certificate and Hillary\'s emails and Comey being on the take.  They think black people are going to sneak up behind them and play the knockout game.  My dad just bought a gun.  They think I\'m crazy, and I feel like when I moved away from home, I left a cult.  I\'m terrified by the thought of who I\'d be if I\'d stayed in the bubble.']","['""or are transgender people along for the ride too?""\n\nVery good question, I hear many Republicans say they have no problem with gays but transgenders is where they draw the line.', ""Not sure if I'm welcome to speak here, I'm Canadian, and obviously therefore neither republican nor democrat, but if I could vote for Hillary or Trump, right now, I would vote Trump.\n\nMy top political priority is LGBT rights. Hands down. After that comes non-violence and ending homelessness. If given the choice between ending  violence and ending homophobia, I would end homophobia.\n\nBut I do think there is a big difference between LGB and T. The first three are sexual preference, and final is gender identity. I think that no laws should discriminate on the basis of sexual preference or gender identity, but I am not sure that the government CAN solve the problems faced by trans people. I can't think of any legislation to introduce or repeal that would help them, that I wouldn't also want to extend to everyone else."", 'Yeah, tbh I\'ve talked to my sister on this and we\'ve agreed the cabinets a bit fucked right now.

', ""I am not OP, but I just wanted to say: yes, the republicans and especially Pence have a completely shit track record on LGBT. \n\nI think if you're going to do a fair comparison, you'd want to compare someone like Shapiro to NPR. Hannity is more partisan, vitriolic and angry, closer to The Young Turks. NPR is where grandparents tune in in AM radio to hear the news.\n\nI say this as a person who listens to both the NPR Politics Podcast and the Ben Shapiro Show to get my daily dose of news."", '> which of the 2 was the most inflamatory in tone\n\ni would love to see more people consume their news with THIS particular criteria in mind. set aside who\'s ""telling the truth"" or what\'s ""fake news"" and listen to the *tone* and what it\'s trying to accomplish. i know full well when i watch ""full frontal with samantha bee"" that she\'s putting an emotional, inciteful liberal spin on the jokes she\'s telling, i don\'t watch her for facts, i watch her to hear impassioned jokes about what i already know. the daily show also deals in comedy but the tone is less inflammatory, and late night with seth meyers even less so. if people can learn to start telling the difference between ""north and south korean leaders held a summit to discuss a peace treaty"" and ""GOD EMPEROR TRUMP BROKERS MIRACULOUS KOREAN REUNIFICATION DEAL #MAGA"" we\'d be a lot better off as a country and globally.', ""First of all, I am extending an olive branch here, take a breath. I will say this, you are resorting to identity politics and polarizing my side, which is what I want to be rid of on all sides. That said there I'll break down what you said; there is more than the republican party on the right. You've got guys like me who are independent, Libertarians \\(like you mentioned\\), Log cabin republicans, etc. There are plenty of people on the right, including myself, who support economic freedom and smaller government and \\*still\\* support LGBT rights. I'm a personal liberties kind of guy, so long as you are not hurting anyone and are not imposing your beliefs on me you are alright in my book. On the note of broadcasters I could do the same song and dance and point to Buzzfeed, Vox, and MTV on how SJW craziness rules your side and when compared to Ben Shapiro, Stephen Crowder, and Jordan Peterson \\(he's not right wing but we like him a lot\\) and say we are more reasonable and willing to have a conversation. The thing is that I know there are reasonable people on the other side and I just wanted to put my hand up and show same goes for over here as well."", ""Right wing doesn't automatically equate to alt right, and OP doesn't sound very alt right to me."", ""You're good it happens.

Now to the good shit.\n\n*You have no idea*. I\'ll let you in a couple secrets you might not know. First, most of us think he is a boob, excluding the minority of supporters. Second, to let you know how we feel about the whole thing and how good we almost had it during the elections two candidates were being groomed for president and vice \\(whoever wasn\'t the primary would become vice\\). They were Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson. One a very successful businesswoman \\(I was for her\\) and the other a former neurosurgeon. Both of them respected politicians and deserving of leadership roles. And we ended up with what we got because he drew the most attention and was more entertaining. Imagine going from Obama to Al Gore \\(someone else idk\\) and you\'ve got how we feel.\n\nInstead of Progressives I prefer to call them Diversity Democrats; has a nicer ring to it. But that\'s just me. Anyway in terms of in\\-fighting it\'s mostly between us and the president, quarrels between commentators most notably Ben Shapiro and Milo Yiannopoulos. On the note of liberal moderates it is interesting to see people like Brett Weinstein and Christina Hoff Summers speaking along side other right wing commentators and engaging in reasonable conversation. If I\'m being completely honest I hope more people get behind them and that way of thinking because it was them that convinced me to take this stance on how the sides interact.\n\nAs for Trump, I can\'t speak for all of us, however it seems like anytime he says something stupid we pretty much say, ""Of course he did. Why wouldn\'t he?"". All I can really say is don\'t trust what you see on the news as what we think. 24 hour news stations \\(regardless of political stance\\) got us here.\n\nAs for the corruption and investigation, I can only speak for myself as everyone got their own opinion on this. Prior to his presidency, I knew about how corrupt his business practices were, especially how he ran competing construction companies out of business in New York. I like that the FBI is doing is taking this seriously and I will trust their judgment. Takes a real patriot to point out whats wrong with an office especially when the FBI is majority Republican.\n\nAs for the future, I don\'t have a damn clue what\'s gonna happen in 2020.

That was done, the MSM just refused to report it, and the folks in the GOP who could have used their bully pulpit to get the word out, chose to not - because McConnell wanted Luther Strange and was willing to lose the seat rather than have a conservative in it (which is why he had the Senate Leadership PAC spend $millions attacking Mo Brooks).\n\n> I\'m 30.

"[""I know for sure that the liberal side is very against this ruling, but I'm curious what the Republican side thinks of this. Do you agree with us, or are you for this ruling? What's your rationale? "", ""This court decision may be correct on the merits, but we need the legislature to get rid of these clauses.  These terms are usually not presented to you until your orientation day.  That means you aren't choosing between your old job and your new job, but between your old job and unemployment.  The contracts are therefore signed under duress."", '> Labor law experts said Monday\'s decision very likely will present increasing problems for the #MeToo movement, and for other civil rights class actions claiming discrimination based on race, gender and religion. There is no transparency in most binding arbitration agreements, and they often include nondisclosure provisions. What\'s more, class actions deal with the expense and fear of retaliation problems of solo claims. As Ginsburg put it, ""there\'s safety in numbers.""\n\n> Yale Law professor Judith Resnik observed that the decision applies to all manner of class actions. ""What this says is that when you buy something, use something, or work for someone, that entity can require you to waive your right to use public courts,"" she noted.\n\nInteresting to see how sexual harrassment claims would go on from now. If you can not do it in courts, do it in media?', '""The policy may be debatable but the law is clear: Congress has instructed that arbitration agreements like those before us must be enforced as written,"" Gorsuch writes. ""While Congress is of course always free to amend this judgment, we see nothing suggesting it did so in the NLRA ‚Äî much less that it manifested a clear intention to displace the Arbitration Act. Because we can easily read Congress\'s statutes to work in harmony, that is where our duty lies.""\n\nGorsuch is exactly right. This doesn\'t mean it\'s wrong to pass a law per se that would make that the case. But it not being the case, the court is bound to rule this way. This just means that the labor unions should lobby to make this the way things are. And given the abuse that this can be subject to, It establishes justice to say that people may not be de facto nor de jure required to surrender or sell their rights.

I think it\'s telling that Ruth Bader Ginsburg\'s dissent is largely talking about how ""unfair"" this interpretation of the law is, which shouldn\'t be something that judges are really considering.\n\nAs for the actual policy, I don\'t feel like I know enough about the issue.  But in general I don\'t like the idea of an employer forcing you to arbitration when you\'d prefer to have your day in court.', ""The ruling is correct as far as I can tell. Even Ruthie's dissent was seemingly based on her desire to change the law as written - though she did pose the proper solution; if we don't like the law, fix the law (in the legislature).\n\nWith that said, I also agree that this is a shit law. Employees (or potential employees) have no power to negotiate terms such as this. You might be able to wiggle around in a range for benefits and such, but when it comes to opting out of such a clause, the immediate red flag would be that there's a potential that you intend to sue later down the road. \n\nPersonally, I feel that all unilateral arbitration clauses are complete shit. It's in absolutely everything now - event tickets, software EULAs, mortgages and other loans, credit card agreements, on the back of sales receipts, quite literally everywhere. And it is almost never in a manner where both parties actually have any negotiation. It's just a take it or leave it condition on whatever it may be attached to."", 'I‚Äôm a republican and I hate this', 'I for one agree with it.

The only real argument is whether the NLRA is in opposition to the 1925 FAA, and the majority has found that:\n\n>Because we can easily read Congress\'s statutes to work in harmony, that is where our duty lies.""\n\nGorsuch is referring to the court\'s duty to refer to Congress, as it is supposed to be. Ginsburg seems to be arguing the wrong thing. She\'s basically saying that since the 1925 law is so old, it shouldn\'t be applicable to the circumstances that the workers are facing today. While both arguments have their merits in their own right, the majority\'s opinion is based upon how the system is supposed to work instead of optimistic idealism.', ""I'd say that the US Constitution doesn't give the government any authority to intrude on the personal dealings of employers and employees, specifically through workers rights legislation. Therefore, the 10th Amendment says leave it to individual states to decide."", 'Not a fan of the idea of giving unions more power. This seems wrong to me', 'I think the ruling was correct, and Congress should clarify the law if they intended it to be otherwise. \n\nThis was a pretty dry statutory case. Gorsuch‚Äôs opinion is pretty on the mark, as far I am concerned. The NLRA does not mandate that class actions be available to workers‚Äîwhich is obvious when you harmonize the statues and recognize that Congress could have made it clear that class actions were available to them regardless of union contracts had they wanted to. It‚Äôs a stretch to say that ‚Äúconcerted activity‚Äù means some kind of particular legal action when the rest of the subsection was directed toward collective bargaining and the like. \n\nBut hell, I‚Äôm all for workers being able to use class actions.

Proving a single case of wage theft and violation of law is hard, doing it with 1000 other cases makes it easier for you to prove your point. But in arbitration it's 1v1 and no past casses are looked at.\n\n\nFinally, the law is law. Should people really be allowed to sign away their rights?

Ellis says he suspects that the only real connection to the Mueller investigation is the hope that Manafort will flip, and keeping the case within Mueller\'s office makes it easier to negotiate the plea deal.\n\nManafort is of course asking that the case be dismissed with prejudice, meaning the charges could never be brought again. This is incredibly unlikely. Even with a skeptical Republican appointed judge like Ellis, the most we are looking at is a dismissal without prejudice followed immediately by the US Attorney\'s office for Eastern District of Virginia refiling the charges.

His strategy is to limit American involvement, to push responsibility for outcomes in the region back onto states in the region, and to let power determine outcomes. He has no particular affinity for states in the region, and professes to be a devoted friend to each without committing to enduring obligations to any. He is indifferent to government type, and just as likely to be a benefactor to authoritarians as to democrats. It is an approach international relations theorists call ‚Äúrealism,‚Äù of the variant called ‚Äúoffshore balancing,‚Äù as he seeks to withdraw U.S. forces from the region.\n\nThis is the end state I desire as far as the middle east is concerned, ""leave it and not have to come back"". \n\nbut how we do that matters.  I give two figs about ""nation building"" but I do care about extremists gaining power and  influence enough to be a threat.  If it were possible to get the middle east to understand, on a generational level, we don\'t fucking care what you do just leave us and everyone else the fuck alone and out of your propaganda, we\'d happily leave.  But sadly, I know the popularity of ""death to America"" all too well...\n\nI don\'t know if this will end up requiring us to return in 6 years, 2 years or 50 but I do know that the message that we just want to leave and not have to comeback is not being heard.  So maybe if we get Iraq and Syria to a point where THEY keep extremists down on their own.\n\n> But he is willing to act punitively and in a limited way to penalize chemical weapons use.  This he has done without letting it upend his strategy: It is not a commitment to change the horrible and predictable outcome of the Syrian civil war; it is narrowly constrained to avoid involving Iran or Russia.\n\nAnd well we should.  I don\'t get what people want here?  Asad or stable middle east, we cant have both... sadly... we learned this with Saddam\n\n> That approach is actually different than Obama‚Äôs.
