"['Too true. Thanks for the wisdom :)', 'You don’t know what my ideas are. You don’t know what I want, so how can you say I’m “fighting with people who want the same thing I do?” Perhaps you should inquire context before jumping to conclusions about me and my...”Bernie-bros,” is it? Assuming things without really knowing or understanding, and not being willing to ask, is a bad habit. Especially online, when things can get heated or mean very quickly. I didn’t vote for Bernie Sanders. \n\nYes, we’re lucky that progressives of past generations helped create a society in which weirdos like me with wild ideas can exist and have a platform. Our society, greatly aided by technology, has changed a lot in just the last 20 years. The way we consume information and discuss that info is much different. My generation understands this and by golly we’re using it and making real change! Young people are more aware and better educated about sociopolitical issues than ever before (thank you internet!). And we’re breaking norms by spreading ideas and taking action via this technology. No, protest isn’t new, but how young people are learning about and recognizing the multitude of ways our country could and should improve and change, and then becoming unlikely activists, is happening more and more, and we’re getting things done faster and faster, impatient of the pace of progress of the past.\n\nOur generation is just getting started, so not sure what you mean by “You are the ones that created it and will have to live with it.” We have to live with the consequences of every decision made by previous generations. We have to live under a government whose systems allowed for somebody like Donald Trump to become president. The multitude of issues we face in this recently-globalized world are overwhelming. Yet instead of ignoring it, more and more young people are getting educated and involved. And we’re just getting started.\n\nI don’t understand why you, and other older folks, seem to find that so problematic. I don’t understand why they are hating on us for recognizing the many faults of our system and speaking up about them. We’re not playing the “blame” game. We’re playing the “let’s fix this” game. If you want to blame yourself, go ahead. We don’t care; we want to move forward. If you’re not willing to support a new generation of like-minded progressives, I wonder why you made us this way? Loud and educated and entitled enough to believe we can change things when challenging power structures that have been in place for generations.\n\nIf you think my generation’s main mode of making change is “stomping feet,” and “tantrums,” you would be wrong. I’d advise you to research the most obvious example of what we’re doing: March for Our Lives. That movement is one of many ways in which my generation is pressuring those in power to do more, to be better.  If you think those kids aren’t working their BUTTS off, you’d be wrong. Not only have they greatly awoken a nation to gun violence, their words and actions have been creating real change in legislation and corporate standards.\n\nI wish my mom, a Democrat, could coast into retirement. Unfortunately, after retiring last year, she had to get another job to support herself and her household. Fun of you to brag bout that tho. I worry a lot about the future of social security in our country, among many other things. Great, your retirement will be flawless and effortless. How about in 50 years? Do you think mine will be great and effortless if the systems don’t change with the times?\n\nWhew, sorry that’s long! Anywho, thanks for your comment. It made me think. I’d like to say my initial post wasn’t meant to place blame. It’s meant to raise awareness of that fact that older generations raised mine, and then complain about how we turned out. I’m proud as can be about how my generation has been getting involved in America, and I look forward to seeing the changes we will make as we grow and take control. I hope you will support us.

Check their website, they listed what laws they wanted implemented, and none of them would do anything to curtail violence\n\nUniversal Background checks:\nYou simply can’t enforce background checks for all private sales, those who were looking for a way around the law will just not get a background check. It’s like mandating all drug dealers have their clients present a drivers license, some are simply not going to do it.\n\nModernizing the ATF:\nThey already have registries in Illinois, but they found he vast vast majority of cases the weapon used in a homicide was illegally obtained or was used by someone other than the registered owner.\n\n\nFund the CDC:\nThe CDC could always do research for it, they just wouldn’t have funding for that program if they did. Even the , we have FBI stats on homicides overall and weapons used in them (vast majority are with handguns, followed by knives, unidentified firearms, fists, shotguns, rifles)\n\nHigh Capacity magazine ban:\nIt didn’t stop Parkland (the shooter used smaller 10 round magazines on purpose, they are more concealable). It didn’t stop Santa Fe (the shooter used a shotgun and a .38, neither holds more than 8 rounds)\n“Oh but what about 100 drum mags”\nIf anything, I’d want a shooter to use drum mags, as in both instances I can recall a drum mag being used in a crime (Aurora and that one Heist in North Vegas), both times the rifle jammed and the user ditched it for a different weapon. Drum mags are notorious for jamming often (several times in a single magazine, which is why he military doesn’t use them).\n\nBan assault weapons:\nAn “assault weapon” as used by gun control advocates is a misnomer. Actual military rifles, such as the M4A1 carbine, have 3-position fire selectors. That means you can set it to safe, semiautomatic (1 trigger pull means 1 round fired), and fully automatic (the gun fires for as long as you hold the trigger and have ammo).\n\nCivilian variants however, only have 2 position fire sectors, safe and semi. They also have narrower lower receivers (the part legally recognized as the gun), meaning you can’t fit a military automatic sear into it. So gun control advocates needed to redefine what assault weapon meant.\n\nSo in response, the Clinton Ban (1994-2004) banned:\nSemiautomatic rifles with detachable magazines with 2 or more features:\n\nForegrip (a piece of plastic you can hold onto)\n\nPistol grip (another piece of plastic you hold onto)\n\nBayonet lug (a metal piece that allows you to mount a knife onto the barrel without duct tape)\n\nGrenade launcher mount (slots and cuts in the gun that allow you to mount a grenade launcher, which are already restricted, without duct tape\n\nThreaded barrel which can mount a flashhider (this device largely just keeps dirt from blowing into your face while firing prone. And while it can “hide” flash, flashes are pretty much invisible in the daytime, and in the darkest of nights you’ll still see a flash, maybe not as big though. However, the gun is still loud, you hear the gun shot and the bullet breaking the sound barrier)\n\nJust another fun fact about the Clinton Ban, overall rifle deaths declined after the ban expired.\n\n\n\nBut looking over their policies, even presuming the “worked”, none of them would have stopped shootings like Virginia Tech, Columbine (which happened during the Clinton Ban), Santa Fe, YouTube, and so on.\n\n\n\nI’m not saying what they went through means nothing, it’s terrible to lose people like that, but it would seem gun free zones don’t work, and that relying on the police alone will fail you (jut like it did at Parkland).\n\n\n']",1

The operative clause’s text and history demonstrate that it connotes an individual right to keep and bear arms. Pp. 2–22.\n\n>(b) The prefatory clause comports with the Court’s interpretation of the operative clause. The “militia” comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense. The Antifederalists feared that the Federal Government would disarm the people in order to disable this citizens’ militia, enabling a politicized standing army or a select militia to rule. The response was to deny Congress power to abridge the ancient right of individuals to keep and bear arms, so that the ideal of a citizens’ militia would be preserved. Pp. 22–28.\n\n> (c) The Court’s interpretation is confirmed by analogous arms-bearing rights in state constitutions that preceded and immediately followed the Second Amendment. Pp. 28–30.\n\n> (d) The Second Amendment’s drafting history, while of dubious interpretive worth, reveals three state Second Amendment proposals that unequivocally referred to an individual right to bear arms. Pp. 30–32.\n\n> (e) Interpretation of the Second Amendment by scholars, courts and legislators, from immediately after its ratification through the late 19th century also supports the Court’s conclusion. Pp. 32–47.\n\n> (f) None of the Court’s precedents forecloses the Court’s interpretation. Neither United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542, nor Presser v. Illinois, 116 U. S. 252, refutes the individual-rights interpretation. United States v. Miller, 307 U. S. 174, does not limit the right to keep and bear arms to militia purposes, but rather limits the type of weapon to which the right applies to those used by the militia, i.e., those in common use for lawful purposes.\n\n> (2) **Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose**: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues. The Court’s opinion should not be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. Miller’s holding that the sorts of weapons protected are those “in common use at the time” finds support in the historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons. Pp. 54–56.\n\n> (3) The handgun ban and the trigger-lock requirement (as applied to self-defense) violate the Second Amendment. The District’s total ban on handgun possession in the home amounts to a prohibition on an entire class of “arms” that Americans overwhelmingly choose for the lawful purpose of self-defense. Under any of the standards of scrutiny the Court has applied to enumerated constitutional rights, this prohibition – in the place where the importance of the lawful defense of self, family, and property is most acute – would fail constitutional muster. Similarly, the requirement that any lawful firearm in the home be disassembled or bound by a trigger lock makes it impossible for citizens to use arms for the core lawful purpose of self-defense and is hence unconstitutional. Because Heller conceded at oral argument that the D.C. licensing law is permissible if it is not enforced arbitrarily and capriciously, the Court assumes that a license will satisfy his prayer for relief and does not address the licensing requirement. Assuming he is not disqualified from exercising Second Amendment rights, the District must permit Heller to register his handgun and must issue him a license to carry it in the home.

The Government has no constitutional duty to subsidize an activity merely because it is constitutionally protected, and may validly choose to allocate public funds for medical services relating to childbirth but not to abortion. That allocation places no governmental obstacle in the path of a woman wishing to terminate her pregnancy, and leaves her with the same choices as if the Government had chosen not to fund family planning services at all. Nor do the regulations place restrictions on the patient/doctor dialogue which violate a woman's right to make an informed and voluntary choice. Unlike the laws invalidated in [other U.S. Supreme Court] cases, which required all doctors to provide all pregnant patients contemplating abortion with specific antiabortion information, here, a doctor's ability to provide, and a woman's right to receive, abortion-related information remains unfettered outside the context of the Title X project. The fact that most Title X clients may be effectively precluded by indigency from seeing a health care provider for abortion-related services does not affect the outcome here, since the financial constraints on such a woman's ability to enjoy the full range of constitutionally protected freedom of choice are the product not of governmental restrictions, but of her indigency.\n""]",1

The local video store has got to be making bank.', 'Pro assault weapons ban, pro magazine limits. Wants to bring back county gun boards for concealed carry permits and give them more discretion.\n\nFollowing is from his website.\n\nGun Safety\n\nAs a new father, I’m learning that you always worry about your child. But when you send them off to school, you shouldn’t have to worry they will fall victim to gun violence. But that story is now all too common in America, from mass shootings in places like Aurora to Kalamazoo and Parkland. But mass shootings are only part of the story – in Detroit, where I was Health Commissioner, death by homicide is the most common cause of death among young men aged 12-35. From 2008-2013, over 6,000 Michiganders were killed by gun violence – making it deadlier than traffic fatalities. And Michigan is also not immune to the epidemic of mass shooters. In 2016, a mentally unstable man who never should have possessed a gun went on a shooting rampage in Kalamazoo, killing six people and 2 others injured.\n\nClearly, gun violence is a national epidemic. Enough is enough.\n\nThe time is long overdue to treat this as the public health issue it is. As Governor of Michigan, I won’t stop working until no parent has to bury her child. Too many elected officials are scared of a corporate gun lobby that is more concerned with making profits for gun manufacturers than promoting responsible gun ownership. I will never take a dime from the gun lobby. I am beholden to no one but the people of Michigan, and I will work for common-sense steps to reduce gun violence and keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn’t have them, like domestic abusers and violent criminals.\n\nHere are my commitments to make Michigan a safer and more responsible state:\n\n1. Prohibit the sale or possession of “weapons of war,” large capacity magazines, and any modifiers that increase fire rate. Growing up, I spent time with my family in Gratiot and Montcalm County - I came to respect Michigan hunting culture and tradition. My own uncle even learned how to prepare the venison he’d hunt halal so that his Muslim family members could also enjoy it. However, we must recognize that military-style assault weapons like the AR-15 – the weapon of choice for mass shooters – are not required to take down a buck. These weapons of war are meant for one thing: killing people during war. For that reason, these weapons and any accessories meant to increase their killing ability should be banned from sale in Michigan.\n\n2. Close background check loopholes. Currently, Michigan law does not require background checks for sales at gun shows, by private sellers, and for the sale of firearms other than handguns. As Governor, I will support background checks for all gun sales, including the sale of long guns. This could be achieved by expanding the current purchase-to-permit system to cover handguns and long guns, so that purchase permits are required to buy any type of guns from private sellers.\n\n3. Include domestic abusers in Michigan’s prohibited purchaser provisions. The presence of a firearm in a Domestic Violence situation makes it 5 times more likely a woman will be murdered. In fact, over half of mass shooter incidents involve the killer shooting intimate partners or other family members, including their children. Currently, Michigan law is incredibly weak when it comes to prohibiting convicted domestic abusers from purchasing or possessing guns. Common sense legislation to prevent domestic abusers from obtaining firearms must do all of the following:\n\n    Prohibit individuals convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors from possessing or purchasing firearms;\n    Require courts to notify individuals convicted of domestic abuse that they are no longer allowed to possess ammunition or firearms;\n    Require the surrender of firearms or ammunition by individuals convicted of domestic abuse;\n    Require law enforcement to remove firearms from the scene of a domestic violence incident.\n\n4. Require the Michigan State Police and local law enforcement to disarm individuals who become prohibited purchasers after purchasing a weapon, being issued a handgun purchase license, or receiving a concealed carry permit. Federal law does not require licensed dealers to conduct a background check if the purchaser presents a state permit to purchase or possess firearms that meet certain conditions. Thus, any Michigander with a handgun purchase license or a concealed pistol license that was issued on or after November 22, 2005 are exempt from the federal background check requirement. This means that people who have become ineligible to possess firearms after getting these licenses may still be able to buy weapons without a background check if the state fails to remove these licenses in a timely manner.\n\n5. Reintroduce discretion into the concealed pistol permit process. Michigan is known as a “shall issue” state, meaning that county clerks - the only body authorized to issue concealed pistol permits - are required to issue permits to all qualified applicants. We need to reintroduce discretion into the process so that communities again have the ability to oversee who can carry a concealed weapon. One way this could be done is through a return to “county gun boards,” which had the final say over the issuance of concealed carry permits before 2000 in Michigan.\n\nMichigan should also implement a “red flag law,” which would allow family members and law enforcement to seek a court order to temporarily restrict or remove access to guns when a person poses a danger to themselves or others. Mass shooters and people contemplating suicide often display warning signs. Red flag laws allow family members and law enforcement to take action before tragedy occurs.\n\n6. Prohibit the open carry of firearms in public buildings and registered private establishments. Small business owners deserve the right to have a say whether or not their customers may carry a gun openly. Under this new system, business owners could enter their establishments into a state registry if they do not wish to allow open carry. And nobody should be able to carry a weapon onto school grounds.\n', ""Only God or Satan can perform tricks at that level, and why would God want to appoint someone to be Governor, He's God.\n\nNot sure what this Abdul character is up to, but he is no part of the Holy Trinity and he sure as hell is not the next Governor."", ""My local city installed a Fiber optic network that you could pay for access to.
