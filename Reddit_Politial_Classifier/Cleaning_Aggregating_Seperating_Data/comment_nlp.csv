And the first shooting involving a civilian AR-15 wouldn‚Äôt be until 2013\n\n\nhttps://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/\n\n\n*assault rifle is often defined as semi automatic rifle win a detachable magazine and 2 of the following:\nForegrip -a piece of hollow plastic you can eat you hand on, literally changing no mechanica function\n\nPistol grip- same as above\n\nBayonet lug- a small block that allows for attachment of a bayonet (yes the knife on the barrel )\n\nMovable stock- specifically one that does not require tools to adjust, under the idea that the wild be to concealed other wise. Keep in mind that rifles have minimum barrel and overall lengths, and that those measurements are taken with the stock at its most compact. \n\nFlash hider or threaded barrel- a device that reduces flash and slightly mitigate some recoil by sending gas upward. Keep in mind the flash it ‚Äúhides‚Äù is already invisible I. The daytime, and still produces a ton of noise \n\n\n\n\nSo with all that in mind, that makes an AR-15 an assault weapon, but not a tiger mini-14. This is largely due to the term ‚Äúassault rifle‚Äù being stretched from the original meaning. Originally, assault rifle meant an intermediate cartridge (bigger thanks handgun round but smaller than a rifle‚Äôs) in a seedy fire rifle (can switch between semi and full auto). Because civilian AR-15‚Äôs aren‚Äôt sect fire, the term had to be stretched, which is what had led to ‚Äúloopholes‚Äù on what is and isn‚Äôt an assault weapon. As the legs definition itself ethically isn‚Äôt an assault rifle.\n', 'Fallacious reasoning, post hoc ergo propter hoc.', 'Man, I remember living under that assault weapons ban in the 90s... what a hellish dictatorship! /s', 'My only reasoning for owning assault weapons is so those rising up have a fighting chance in civil war 2.

They don‚Äôt see these moments as *evidence* of an unfit president but rather the *defamation* of one. \n\nI used to be friends with a MAGA shmuck who is rather bright (book wise I guess), though lacking common sense in many areas and a bit bigoted though he didn‚Äôt think so. We‚Äôd often have political discussions even before 2016 and though had our difference, could meet in the middle. They used to be constructive conversations until *J* started having a rough go at the end of 14 beginning of 15. By the time Trump splashed onto the scene, there was no getting through. He simply *couldn‚Äôt* acknowledge any negatives honestly, they were nothing‚Äôs for him. \n\nJ was by no means a bad guy, which is a real fucked thing to say following my previous statement, but in his reality he had basically one chance to get himself through school financially speaking. We could all see he was being overly ambitious in his career choice but what young person isn‚Äôt? Like a lot of people I know, he had changed courses a couple times and exhausted his financial aid. After only 3 years in post-secondary he was unable to acquire loans or student aid, to which he blamed ‚Äúthe system‚Äù despite him making horrible and expensive decisions and ultimately not achieving the grades he needed to. \n\nIt was not long after that a populist *billionaire* comes onto the scene preaching to be for the people who wants to *drain the swamp*. That really must have resonated. I hadn‚Äôt talked to him specifically about this, but I imagine he felt stuck at the time and latched onto Trump for all the same reasons you can read about. Ultimately I think he was just desperate. \n\nThe *real issue* I‚Äôm trying to highlight, as I believe was that his friends (myself included) all took the opposition in attacking Trumps character (qualifications and credibility etc etc) as being unfit to honestly represent the American people. *j* eventually became unable to separate the arguments against someone he supported from his own character and just became bitter about everything. His closeted bigotry surely did not help. \n\nHe‚Äôs always had an argumentative personality that had pushed most of his friends away, it‚Äôs just that recently I (one of his long standing friends) realized how truly toxic he became over the years. So while I don‚Äôt think Trump is entirely the reason this guy became an ‚Äúagainst the grain asshole‚Äù as a mutual friend elegantly put it, MAGA was definitely a catalyst and attacking Trumps intelligence is likely a major *micro-factor*. \n\nBut seriously, if the man could just hire an editor and read a prompt. . .\n\n\nEdit: forgot to finish a point.

These were the classifications for projects back during the New Deal:\n\nStructural improvements: bridges, fire lookout towers, service buildings\n\nTransportation: truck trails, minor roads, foot trails and airport landing fields\n\nErosion control: check dams, terracing, and vegetable covering\n\nFlood control: irrigation, drainage, dams, ditching, channel work, riprapping\n\nForest culture: planting trees and shrubs, timber stand improvement, seed collection, nursery work\n\nForest protection: fire prevention, fire pre-suppression, firefighting, insect and disease control\n\nLandscape and recreation: public camp and picnic ground development, lake and pond site clearing and development\n\nRange: stock driveways, elimination of predatory animals (and removal of invasive species)\n\nWildlife: stream improvement, fish stocking, food and cover planting\n\nMiscellaneous: emergency work, surveys, mosquito control\n\nCan also add species monitoring, training them in basic spottings of wildlife and then tracking that data to detect possibly endangered species, where they are being found, etc.\n\n* Farming work in urban areas, rooftop gardens and the like, to address America\'s nutrition problem in poverty stricken areas.\n\n* As an extension of that, management of small community gardens to provide fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\n* Maintenance and cleaning of public areas and government buildings.\n\n* Composting - an area where cities and towns have a lot of room to expand upon.\n\nCommunity projects:\n\n* Keep vacant areas looking nice, maintaining the town\'s image, general landscaping work like that which can be done by anyone.\n\n* Small infrastructure projects modeled again on a New Deal program, the Works Progress Administration. Their projects [still live on](https://livingnewdeal.org/map/) to this day and the same can happen with this to advance society as a whole. \n\n* Managing the program itself on the local levels. Lots of workers must be assigned!\n\n* Managing coworking spaces and incubators to foster a spirit of innovation.\n\n* Construction of simple Green Energy projects to ease society off of fossil fuels and towards renewable energy.\n\n* Establishment and management of ""tool libraries"" and other services that would make it easier for people to carry out routine improvement work, improving the image of the community as a whole.\n\n* Teaching of classes and programs of any sort:\n\n- This includes prison classes, helping to bring inmates back into society as other countries have succeeded in.\n\n* If someone has extraordinary talent, a small-scale program similar to the New Deal\'s Federal Project Number One can be implemented to allow these artists, musicians, poets, playrights, etc. to function. Of course the fruits of that program are still with us today!\n\n* Constructing more small scale playgrounds and managing other areas for kids to hang out to divert them from, say, a gang influenced life or a drug addiction, with the opioid problem being so big across the country.\n\n* Better pedestrian pathways, bike lanes, carpooling programs, and new mass transit bus routes can be added, all of which promote a more sustainable system and cut down on traffic.\n\n* Add more extended school day programs to allow parents to work and be productive while ensuring that kids learn more and there is more time for them to relax during the school day, and...\n\n* Universal Childcare can be implemented taking a major burden off the hands of many members of the working class.\n\n* Teachers in some areas can recieve assistance managing young children or giving special attention to some who are behind the curve. We know they need the help!\n\n* Sports coaches, as part of an established after-school or weekend program, can be added in here and there to supplement hours while still providing a social good, ditto for extending library hours!\n\n* National hospice program for those that have no family members to take care of them and no money to afford a nursing home, workers can help these people perform their basic living tasks at certain scheduled times in the day.\n\n* Assign people to help non-profit organizations that need assistance in helping the community, excempting religious/political groups.\n\n* More assistance for veterans who may be disabled, and disabled people in general.\n\n* Special skills can be utilized. For example a researcher may spend time continuing to advance the public knowledge sphere by continuing their research, or someone trained in mental health may be able to provide counseling services to the depressed(maybe that\'ll help this mass shooting problem!)\n\n* Adminstrative assistance can be provided in terms of paperwork, etc. for those looking to start a small business to foster an entreprenuerial culture.\n\n* Apprenticeships and on-the-job training programs with other public workers, to count towards valuable job experience.\n', ""Likely 2020 candidates?

"['It‚Äôs why Trumps insecurities dominate every aspect of his life. Trumps peaks and valleys in life are hills not mountains. In most people‚Äôs lives there‚Äôs a situation where you‚Äôre backed into a corner with no way out. You can‚Äôt ask someone to deal with it for you. Whether it‚Äôs having to sleep in a car for a month, being unemployed for an extended period of time. Have debt collectors calling you. Have no transportation to work. \n\nThose are experiences that mold a person. They‚Äôre horrible but give a person perspective on life.\n\nTrump has never had to work his way up. He‚Äôs never had to grind out the shitty jobs that get your foot in the door. Doing that shitty work makes you see that it‚Äôs the low guys who determine how well an operation functions. \n\nI just think of the picture of Obama fist bumping the custodian in the WH. I‚Äôve worked as a janitor/custodian when that picture was released. It showed me a lot. Obama isn‚Äôt too good for anyone and recognizes those people allow him to not spend his time dealing with that stuff. \n\nTrump stiffs his contractors. \n\nObama was not a perfect man. He made decisions that will be debated on for many years. But as the face of the country, growing up in a one parent home, beat the odds, he‚Äôs charismatic. Articulate, intelligent, and he always wanted to do the right thing. A devoted husband and father, a loving family, a sense of humor, takes the high road, cares deeply about the country. Obama told Trump not to hire Flynn, not because of a vendetta or to influence Trump but because Flynn would be a liability in that spot and it wouldn‚Äôt be good for the country. \n\nObama was someone that was a personification of the American Dream. He was what many of us aspire to be. Overcome our misfortunes, work hard, care, love, experience, learn, listen, optimistic. Obama didn‚Äôt need to compare himself to others for reassurance. He was self confident because he understood there are too many variables that it‚Äôs useless. The crisis‚Äô are unique for every one. \n\nUltimately though, Obama respected others and understanding of others. He got frustrated at times, he would criticize the other party for games they were playing. But he never told people they don‚Äôt love America because they disagree with me. He understood the reasoning behind not standing for the national anthem,(I believe he disagreed with it but support their right to do it). He didn‚Äôt whine about his media coverage. He never called for a reporter to be fired because of a mistake that later was corrected. \n\nHe brought in people he disagreed with, he listened to them. He brought in people with expertise in their field to run that section. He brought in people who were not ethical nightmares. \n\nObama‚Äôs worst qualities as a human and or leader and still better than Trumps best qualities.

Mueller\'s team continues to say that there is a connection that puts the charges within the scope, but that due national security concerns and the ongoing investigation, they can\'t tell the judge. Ellis doesn\'t seem to buy that, which is understandable since it\'s pretty darn hard to rule on this motion without that information. Ellis says he suspects that the only real connection to the Mueller investigation is the hope that Manafort will flip, and keeping the case within Mueller\'s office makes it easier to negotiate the plea deal.\n\nManafort is of course asking that the case be dismissed with prejudice, meaning the charges could never be brought again. This is incredibly unlikely. Even with a skeptical Republican appointed judge like Ellis, the most we are looking at is a dismissal without prejudice followed immediately by the US Attorney\'s office for Eastern District of Virginia refiling the charges.

"['> But it‚Äôs wrong to suggest, as Martin Indyk concludes in The Atlantic, that the Trump administration‚Äôs Middle East policy is effectively no different from President Obama‚Äôs ‚Äúleading from behind.‚Äù Critics are not giving Trump enough credit: He does have a strategy for Syria and the broader Middle East. His strategy is to limit American involvement, to push responsibility for outcomes in the region back onto states in the region, and to let power determine outcomes. He has no particular affinity for states in the region, and professes to be a devoted friend to each without committing to enduring obligations to any. He is indifferent to government type, and just as likely to be a benefactor to authoritarians as to democrats. It is an approach international relations theorists call ‚Äúrealism,‚Äù of the variant called ‚Äúoffshore balancing,‚Äù as he seeks to withdraw U.S. forces from the region.\n\nThis is the end state I desire as far as the middle east is concerned, ""leave it and not have to come back"". \n\nbut how we do that matters.  I give two figs about ""nation building"" but I do care about extremists gaining power and  influence enough to be a threat.  If it were possible to get the middle east to understand, on a generational level, we don\'t fucking care what you do just leave us and everyone else the fuck alone and out of your propaganda, we\'d happily leave.  But sadly, I know the popularity of ""death to America"" all too well...\n\nI don\'t know if this will end up requiring us to return in 6 years, 2 years or 50 but I do know that the message that we just want to leave and not have to comeback is not being heard.  So maybe if we get Iraq and Syria to a point where THEY keep extremists down on their own.\n\n> But he is willing to act punitively and in a limited way to penalize chemical weapons use.  This he has done without letting it upend his strategy: It is not a commitment to change the horrible and predictable outcome of the Syrian civil war; it is narrowly constrained to avoid involving Iran or Russia.\n\nAnd well we should.  I don\'t get what people want here?  Asad or stable middle east, we cant have both... sadly... we learned this with Saddam\n\n> That approach is actually different than Obama‚Äôs.
