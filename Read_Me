Thank you for taking the time to look at my portfolio.  

Although I only have 3 projects available for view at the moment I will be adding a major one within a few weeks and have several smaller projects that still need to be cleaned through before adding them here. 

I am currently a flegling data scientist with a good amount of experience as an Analyst.  I have exposure to most of the models a data scientist would use and am currently expanding my knowledge of these models while adapting them to big data scenarios. (7/12)

Feel free to contact me anytime, I am always interested in new oppurtunities, particularly I am looking for an internship oppurtunity or an open-source project in the political sector.
